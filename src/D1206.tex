We propose facilities to make constructing containers from ranges more convenient.

\section{Revisions}

\subsection*{Revision 7}
Wording changes
\begin{itemize}
    \item \tcode{ranges::from_iterator_t} was incorrectly spelled in a number of places
    \item Constrain \tcode{ranges::to} and containter \tcode{from_range_t} overload with \tcode{convertible_to} consistently. The concern was that
    if \tcode{ranges::to} is not properly concerns it might try to construct improperly constrained non-standard types.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Revision 6}
\begin{itemize}
    \item At LEWG's request, rename \tcode{push_front_range} and \tcode{push_back_range} to \tcode{prepend_range} and \tcode{append_range} respectively.
    (\tcode{push_range} in containers adaptors is not renamed!)
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Revision 5}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Add \tcode{push_back_range} and \tcode{push_front_range} methods at SG9 request
    \item Fix some wording issues
    \item Add notes on performance + benchmarks
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Revision 4}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Add \tcode{from_range_t} and methods taking ranges to most containers
    \item Improve the wording of \tcode{ranges::to}
    \item \tcode{ranges::to} calls reserve when possible
    \item Rewrite the motivation
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Revision 3}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Add support for \tcode{from_range_t}
    \item Add support for nested containers
    \item Remove syntax without parenthesis
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Revision 2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Remove the implicit const removal when converting an associative container to a container of pairs
    \item Use CTAD to determine the value type of the returned container
    \item Attempt at wording
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Revision 1}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Split out the proposed constructors for string view and span into separate papers (\cite{P1391} and \cite{P1394} respectively)
    \item Use a function based approach rather than adding a constructor to standard containers, as it proved unworkable.
\end{itemize}


\section{Overview}

We propose 2 facilites to make it easier to construct container and from ranges:

\begin{itemize}
\item \tcode{ranges::to} a function that can materialize any range as a container, including non-standard containers, and recursive containers
\item tagged constructors, \tcode{insert} and \tcode{assign} methods for standard containers and string types.
\end{itemize}


We propose that all the following syntaxes be valid constructs.
The examples are meant to illustrate the interface's capabilities - the primary use case for it is to materialize views, even if copying from one container type to another is possible.

\begin{colorblock}
auto l = std::views::iota(1, 10);

// create a vector with the elements of l
auto vec = ranges::to<std::vector<int>>(l); // or vector{std::from_range, l};

//Specify an allocator
auto b = ranges::to<std::vector<int, Alloc>>(l, alloc); // or vector{std::from_range, l, alloc};

//deducing value_type
auto c = ranges::to<std::vector>(l);

// explicit conversion int -> long
auto d = ranges::to<std::vector<long>>(l);


//Supports converting associative container to sequence containers
auto f = ranges::to<vector>(m);

//Supports converting sequence containers to associative ones
auto g = ranges::to<map>(f);

//Pipe syntaxe
auto g = l | ranges::view::take(42) | ranges::to<std::vector>();

//Pipe syntax with allocator
auto h = l | ranges::view::take(42) | ranges::to<std::vector>(alloc);

//The pipe syntax also support specifying the type and conversions
auto i = l | ranges::view::take(42) | ranges::to<std::vector<long>>();

// Nested ranges
std::list<std::forward_list<int>> lst = {{0, 1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6, 7}};
auto vec1 = ranges::to<std::vector<std::vector<int>>>(lst);
auto vec2 = ranges::to<std::vector<std::deque<double>>>(lst);

\end{colorblock}

\section{Design Notes}

\tcode{from_range} is declared as an instance of a tag_type \tcode{from_range_t} in \tcode{std}.

\subsection{\tcode{ranges::to}}

\tcode{ranges::to<C>(r, args)} returns an instance \tcode{c} of \tcode{C} constructed by the first valid method among the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Construct \tcode{c} from r
    \item Construct \tcode{c} from r using the tagged ranged constructor (\tcode{from_range_t})
    \item Construct \tcode{c} from the pair of iterators \tcode{ranges::begin(r), ranges::end(r)}
    \item Construct \tcode{c}, then insert each element of \tcode{r} at the end of \tcode{c}.
    \item If \tcode{C} is a \tcode{range} whose value type is itself a \tcode{range} (and is not a \tcode{view}), and \tcode{r}'s value type is also a \tcode{range}, the application of \tcode{to<range_value_t<C>>} for each element of \tcode{r} is inserted
    at the end of c.
\end{itemize}

Any additional arguments passed to \tcode{to} are forwarded as the last parameters of the constructor, in order to support allocators.
This also allow passing comparators, hasher, etc to containers when applicable.

\subsection{Containers range constructors and methods}

For any constructor or methods taking a pair of \tcode{InputIterator}s in containers (with the exception of \tcode{regex} and \tcode{filesystem::path}), a similar method, suffixed with \tcode{_range} is added taking a range instead.

In addition, by SG9 request. \tcode{push_front_range} and \tcode{push_back_range} are added when an equivalent \tcode{push_front}
or \tcode{push_back} exists.

\textbf{\tcode{prepend_range} and \tcode{append_range} both preserve the order of elements.}
Notably, \tcode{prepend_range} does not reverse the order of the elements in the inserted range.
Both because we think this would be surprising for most people and because it would require \tcode{bidirectional_range},
which would make it less useful. It is possible to use \tcode{reverse_view} to reverse the elements of the inserted range,
which seems like the natural way to express that intent.


All added constructors are tagged with \tcode{from_range_t}. Methods that may be ambiguous are suffixed with \tcode{_range}.

The container's value type must be explicitly constructible from the reference type of the \tcode{input_range} \tcode{Range}.

The following methods and constructors are added to all sequence containers (\tcode{vector, deque, list, forward_list}):

\begin{itemize}
    \item \tcode{Container(from_range_t, Range\&\&, const Allocator\& = \{\});}
    \item \tcode{iterator insert_range(const_iterator position, Range\&\&);} (\tcode{insert_after_range} in \tcode{forward_list})
\end{itemize}

\tcode{vector}, \tcode{deque}, \tcode{list}, \tcode{vector} gain:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \tcode{void append_range(Range\&\&);}
\end{itemize}

\tcode{deque}, \tcode{forward_list}, \tcode{list} gain:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \tcode{void prepend_range(Range\&\&);}
\end{itemize}


\tcode{basic_string} gains:

\begin{itemize}
\item \tcode{basic_string(from_range_t, Range\&\&, const Allocator\& = \{\});}
\item \tcode{iterator insert_range(const_iterator position, Range\&\&);}
\item \tcode{basic_string\& assign_range(Range\&\&);}
\item \tcode{basic_string\& replace_range(const_iterator, const_iterator, Range\&\&);}
\item \tcode{basic_string\& append_range(Range\&\&);}
\item \tcode{void append_range(Range\&\&);}
\end{itemize}

The following methods and constructors are added to associative containers (\tcode{set, multiset, map, multimap})

\begin{itemize}
    \item \tcode{Container(from_range_t, Range\&\&, const Compare\& = \{\}, const Allocator\& = \{\});}
    \item \tcode{void insert_range(Range\&\&);}
\end{itemize}

The following methods and constructors are added to unordered containers (\tcode{unordered_set, unordered_multiset, unordered_map, unordered_multimap}):

\begin{itemize}
    \item \tcode{Container(from_range_t, Range\&\&, size_t n = /**/, const hasher\& = \{\}, const key_equal\& =\{\}, const Allocator\& = \{\});}
    \item \tcode{Container(from_range_t, Range\&\&, size_t n, const Allocator\&);}
    \item \tcode{Container(from_range_t, Range\&\&, size_t n, const hasher\&, const Allocator\&);}
    \item \tcode{void insert_range(Range\&\&);}.
\end{itemize}

\tcode{priority_queue} gains:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \tcode{priority_queue(from_range_t, Range\&\&, const Compare\& = \{\});}
    \item \tcode{priority_queue(from_range_t, Range\&\&, const Compare, const Alloc\&);}
    \item \tcode{priority_queue(from_range_t, Range\&\&, const Alloc\&);}
    \item \tcode{void push_range(Range\&\&);}.
\end{itemize}

\tcode{stack} and \tcode{queue} gain:

\begin{itemize}
   \item \tcode{Container(from_range_t, Range\&\&);}
   \item \tcode{Container(from_range_t, Range\&\&, const Alloc\&);}
   \item \tcode{void push_range(Range\&\&);}.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Note that for \tcode{stack, queue, priority_queue}, \tcode{push_range} do not requires an equivalent \tcode{append_range}
method to exists}.

For every constructor, a deduction guide is added.


\section{Considerations}


\subsection{Why do we need this?}

Containers do not have containers constructors, so

\begin{colorblock}
vector v = views::iota(0, 10);
\end{colorblock}

is currently not valid syntax.

They do have a constructors taking a pair of iterators.
So, it would theorically be possible to write:

\begin{colorblock}
auto view = views::iota(0, 10);
vector<int> v(ranges::begin(view), ranges::end(view));
\end{colorblock}

Which is more cumbersome. But that isn't enough! Containers expect the same types for both iterators - they do not support sentinels.
A solution would be to write:
\begin{colorblock}
auto view = views::iota(0, 10) | views::commom;
vector<int> v(ranges::begin(view), ranges::end(view));
\end{colorblock}

And that still does not always work. `Cpp17Iterators` requiered by containers can have slightly different semantics.
Namely, `input_iterator` may not be copyable. So the following does not work:

\begin{colorblock}
std::generator<std::pair<int, string>> f() {
   co_yield {0, "Hello"};
   co_yield {1, "World"};
}
auto view = f(); // attempts to use views::common here would be ill-formed
map<int, std::string> v(ranges::begin(view), ranges::end(view));
\end{colorblock}

Instead, one has to insert each element manually.

This is sufficiently complex and error-prone approach that multiple blog posts and stackoverflow questions address it:

\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://timur.audio/how-to-make-a-container-from-a-c20-range}{How to make a container from a C++20 range}
\item \href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59452296/will-we-be-able-to-construct-containers-with-views-in-c20}{Will we be able to construct containers with views in C++20?}
\item \href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62043660/range-concept-and-containers-constructors}{Range concept and containers constructors}
\item \href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62043660/range-concept-and-containers-constructors}{Initializing std::vector with ranges library}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Why do we need a tag / different method names ?}

Ambiguities can arise in 2 cases. Using different methods resolves these ambiguities.

\subsubsection{CTAD}

Consider the following code:

\begin{colorblock}
std::list<int> l;
std::vector v{l};
\end{colorblock}

Should \tcode{v} be \tcode{std::vector<int>} or \tcode{std::vector<std::list<int>>} ?
It is currently equivalent to the latter!
Adding a tag solves this issue(although one needs to remember using a tag!).

\subsubsection{Ambiguous conversions}

There are other issues is with \tcode{vector<any>}.

\begin{colorblock}
std::list<any> l;
std::vector<any> v;
v.insert(l);
\end{colorblock}

Does that insert a range of any or a single any?
Using a different name resolves this ambiguity.

\tcode{assign} always takes a range or count + value, so it does not suffer this ambiguity.

\subsection{Do we need both approaches?}
Both approaches are complementary. \tcode{ranges::to} works with non-standard containers and supports constructing containers of containers.
Tagged constructors offer an opportunity for containers to provide a more efficient implementation.
For example, many containers do not have a \tcode{reserve} method.
\tcode{ranges::to} uses the tagged constructor when available.
As such, tagged constructors offer a customization mechanism to opt-in into ranges::to and could be extended to things that are not containers.

\tcode{ranges::to} does not replace the proposed \tcode{insert_range} and \tcode{assign_range} methods.

While we recommend pursuing both approaches, it is essential to make sure \tcode{ranges::to} is part of C++23 as it is a critical missing piece of
ranges. The two approaches can easily be split off if necessary.

\subsection{Performance Consideration}

In many cases, a container can implement range construction more efficiently than ranges can,
notably, because it has access to the initialized memory.

We can demonstrate that by comparing 3 scenarios:

\textbf{Iterator construction}
\begin{colorblock}
    auto c = range | views::common;
    std::vector<T> v(c.begin(), c.end());
\end{colorblock}

\textbf{reserve + copy (similar to ranges::to in the absence of tags)}
\begin{colorblock}
    std::vector<T*> v;
    v.reserve(std::ranges::distance(range));
    std::ranges::copy(range, std::back_inserter(v));
\end{colorblock}

\textbf{using \tcode{from_range}}
\begin{colorblock}
    std::vector vector(std::ranges::from_range, range);
\end{colorblock}

Barry Revzin tested different scenarios and reported the following numbers:

\textbf{A} A random access, sized, common range of prvalue char const* (so, an input range in C++17) constructing a vector<string>.

\textbf{B} A random access, non-sized, non-common range of lvalue string (so, a forward range in C++17) constructing a vector<string>

\textbf{C} A random access, sized, common range of prvalue char const* constructing a vector<char const*> (so, the individual element construction is very cheap).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    &  iterators constructor & reserve + copy &  \tcode{from_range_t} constructor\\
    \hline
    A & 90.9µs & 57.0µs & 52.3µs  \\
    \hline
    B & 79.4µs  & 69.7µs &67.9µs \\
    \hline
    C & 3.7µs & 4.8µs & 1.8µs\\
    \hline
\end{tabular}

I've reproduced scenarios A\&C on \href{https://quick-bench.com/q/Vlt2DSLpXejPNR-L-Dx_kOfImnk}{QuickBench}

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{P1206_bench_a}
% https://quick-bench.com/q/aWpqVs5RODKoKJ0HPEBbslEn1Ds

In both scenarios, the \tcode{from_range} constructor performs significantly
better than both the iterator pair constructor and the reserve + copy method employed by \tcode{ranges::to}

Because \tcode{ranges::to} will call a tag constructor when there is one, it show the same difference.

\subsection{Do we need iterator/sentinel pair constructors as well?}


The new standard library algorithms in the `std::ranges` namespace all provide multiple overloads taking both a range and an iterator/sentinel pair. This raises the question: should our new constructors provide a "range" overload (only), an iterator/sentinel pair overload (only), or both?

The second case (an iterator/sentinel pair only) is easily dismissed. There exist ranges which model \tcode{sized_range}, but whose iterators/sentinels do not model \tcode{sized_sentinel_for} - the canonical example being \tcode{std::list}. With such types, a constructor call like

\begin{colorblock}
std::list<int> list = get_list();
std::vector<int> vec(std::from_range, list); // copy into vector
\end{colorblock}

would know the size of the list and would therefore be able to allocate the required vector size upfront. On the other hand, a hypothetical call to

\begin{colorblock}
std::list<int> list = get_list();
std::vector<int> vec(std::from_range, list.begin(), list.end());
\end{colorblock}

cannot know the size of the input range upfront, and so would need two passes over the data.

We are thus left to decide whether to provide an iterator/sentinel constructor in addition to a "range" constructor. In the authors' opinion, this would be redundant. In cases where we do have separate iterator and sentinel objects that we wish to pass to a container constructor, we can do so using `subrange`, as in

\begin{colorblock}
std::vector vec(std::from_range, subrange(my_iter, my_sentinel));
\end{colorblock}

Furthermore, it is intended that users should be able to opt-in to \tcode{ranges::to} support for their own container classes by providing constructors which take \tcode{from_range_t} as their first argument. Adding iterator/sentinel constructors in addition to "range" constructors means more work for users to adhere to the protocol, and no doubt risks confusion about whether one, either, or both are required.

\subsection{\placeholder{reservable-container} concept}

The exposition only \placeholder{reservable-container} concepts checks for
\begin{itemize}
    \item \tcode{reserve}
    \item \tcode{max_size}
    \item \tcode{capacity}
\end{itemize}

which is consistent with ranges-v3. This serves multiple purposes:

\begin{itemize}
\item Avoid calling \tcode{reserve} on unordered containers and others entities that have a reserve method with different
semantics
\item Allow implementations to check that we are not trying to reserve more than max size
\end{itemize}


\section{Implementation Experience}

Implementations of \tcode{ranges::to} are available in \cite{Range V3}, \cite{cmcstl2} and on Github \cite{rangesnext}.
The tagged ranges constructors, insert methods and other range-taking container members fuctions have \textbf{not} been
implemented.

\section{Related Paper and future work}

Future work is needed to allow constructing \tcode{std::array} from \EXPO{tiny-ranges}.
This paper also do not proposes modifications of \tcode{path}(the author is not familiar with it enough) and \tcode{regex} (whose fate is in the balance).

\rSec2[associative.reqmts]{Associative containers}

\rSec3[associative.reqmts.general]{General}

\pnum
Associative containers provide fast retrieval of data based on keys.
The library provides four basic kinds of associative containers:
\tcode{set},
\tcode{multiset},
\tcode{map}
and
\tcode{multimap}.

\pnum
Each associative container is parameterized on
\tcode{Key}
and an ordering relation
\tcode{Compare}
that induces a strict weak ordering\iref{alg.sorting} on
elements of
\tcode{Key}.
In addition,
\tcode{map}
and
\tcode{multimap}
associate an arbitrary \term{mapped type}
\tcode{T}
with the
\tcode{Key}.
The object of type
\tcode{Compare}
is called the
\term{comparison object}
of a container.

\pnum
The phrase ``equivalence of keys'' means the equivalence relation imposed by the
comparison object.
That is, two keys
\tcode{k1}
and
\tcode{k2}
are considered to be equivalent if for the
comparison object
\tcode{comp},
\tcode{comp(k1, k2) == false \&\& comp(k2, k1) == false}.
\begin{note}
    This is not necessarily the same as the result of \tcode{k1 == k2}.
\end{note}
For any two keys
\tcode{k1}
and
\tcode{k2}
in the same container, calling
\tcode{comp(k1, k2)}
shall always return the same value.

\pnum
An associative container supports \term{unique keys} if it may contain at
most one element for each key. Otherwise, it supports \term{equivalent keys}.
The \tcode{set} and \tcode{map} classes support unique keys; the \tcode{multiset}
and \tcode{multimap} classes support equivalent keys.
For \tcode{multiset} and \tcode{multimap},
\tcode{insert}, \tcode{emplace}, and \tcode{erase} preserve the relative ordering
of equivalent elements.

\pnum
For \tcode{set} and \tcode{multiset} the value type is the same as the key type.
For \tcode{map} and \tcode{multimap} it is equal to \tcode{pair<const Key, T>}.

\pnum
\tcode{iterator}
of an associative container is of the bidirectional iterator category.
For associative containers where the value type is the same as the key type, both
\tcode{iterator}
and
\tcode{const_iterator}
are constant iterators. It is unspecified whether or not
\tcode{iterator}
and
\tcode{const_iterator}
are the same type.
\begin{note}
    \tcode{iterator} and \tcode{const_iterator} have identical semantics in this case, and \tcode{iterator} is convertible to \tcode{const_iterator}. Users can avoid violating the one-definition rule by always using \tcode{const_iterator} in their function parameter lists.
\end{note}

\pnum
The associative containers meet all the requirements of Allocator-aware
containers\iref{container.requirements.general}, except that for
\tcode{map} and \tcode{multimap}, the requirements placed on \tcode{value_type}
in \tref{container.alloc.req} apply instead to \tcode{key_type}
and \tcode{mapped_type}.
\begin{note}
    For example, in some cases \tcode{key_type} and \tcode{mapped_type}
    are required to be \oldconcept{CopyAssignable} even though the associated
    \tcode{value_type}, \tcode{pair<const key_type, mapped_type>}, is not
    \oldconcept{CopyAssignable}.

\pnum
The \tcode{insert}\added{, \tcode{insert\char`_range},} and \tcode{emplace} members shall not affect the validity of
iterators and references to the container,
and the \tcode{erase} members shall invalidate only iterators and
references to the erased elements.

\pnum
The \tcode{extract} members invalidate only iterators to the removed element;
pointers and references to the removed element remain valid. However, accessing
the element through such pointers and references while the element is owned by
a \tcode{node_type} is undefined behavior. References and pointers to an element
obtained while it is owned by a \tcode{node_type} are invalidated if the element
is successfully inserted.

\pnum
The fundamental property of iterators of associative containers is that they iterate through the containers
in the non-descending order of keys where non-descending is defined by the comparison that was used to
construct them.
For any two dereferenceable iterators
\tcode{i}
and
\tcode{j}
such that distance from
\tcode{i}
to
\tcode{j}
is positive, the following condition holds:

\begin{codeblock}
    value_comp(*j, *i) == false
\end{codeblock}

\pnum
For associative containers with unique keys the stronger condition holds:

\begin{codeblock}
    value_comp(*i, *j) != false
\end{codeblock}

\pnum
When an associative container is constructed by passing a comparison object the
container shall not store a pointer or reference to the passed object,
even if that object is passed by reference.
When an associative container is copied, through either a copy constructor
or an assignment operator,
the target container shall then use the comparison object from the container
being copied,
as if that comparison object had been passed to the target container in
its constructor.

\pnum
The member function templates
\tcode{find}, \tcode{count}, \tcode{contains},
\tcode{lower_bound}, \tcode{upper_bound}, and \tcode{equal_range}
shall not participate in overload resolution unless
the \grammarterm{qualified-id} \tcode{Compare::is_transparent} is valid
and denotes a type\iref{temp.deduct}.

\pnum
A deduction guide for an associative container shall not participate in overload resolution
if any of the following are true:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It has an \tcode{InputIterator} template parameter
    and a type that does not qualify as an input iterator is deduced for that parameter.

    \item It has an \tcode{Allocator} template parameter
    and a type that does not qualify as an allocator is deduced for that parameter.

    \item It has a \tcode{Compare} template parameter
    and a type that qualifies as an allocator is deduced for that parameter.

\pnum
Two unordered containers \tcode{a} and \tcode{b} compare equal if
\tcode{a.size() == b.size()} and, for every equivalent-key group
\range{Ea1}{Ea2} obtained from \tcode{a.equal_range(Ea1)}, there exists an
equivalent-key group \range{Eb1}{Eb2} obtained from \tcode{b.equal_range(Ea1)},
such that
\tcode{is_permutation(Ea1, Ea2, Eb1, Eb2)} returns \tcode{true}. For
\tcode{unordered_set} and \tcode{unordered_map}, the complexity of
\tcode{operator==} (i.e., the number of calls to the \tcode{==} operator
of the \tcode{value_type}, to the predicate returned by \tcode{key_eq()},
and to the hasher returned by \tcode{hash_function()}) is proportional to
$N$ in the average case and to $N^2$ in the worst case, where $N$ is
\tcode{a.size()}. For \tcode{unordered_multiset} and \tcode{unordered_multimap},
the complexity of \tcode{operator==} is proportional to $\sum E_i^2$
in the average case and to $N^2$ in the worst case, where $N$ is \tcode{a.size()},
and $E_i$ is the size of the $i^\text{th}$ equivalent-key group in \tcode{a}.
However, if the respective elements of each corresponding pair of
equivalent-key groups $Ea_i$ and $Eb_i$ are arranged in the same order
(as is commonly the case, e.g., if \tcode{a} and \tcode{b} are unmodified copies
of the same container), then the average-case complexity for
\tcode{unordered_multiset} and \tcode{unordered_multimap} becomes
proportional to $N$ (but worst-case complexity remains \bigoh{N^2}, e.g., for
a pathologically bad hash function). The behavior of a program that uses
\tcode{operator==} or \tcode{operator!=} on unordered containers is undefined
unless the \tcode{Pred} function object has
the same behavior for both containers and the equality comparison function
for \tcode{Key} is a refinement
\footnote{
    Equality comparison is a refinement
    of partitioning if no two objects that
    compare equal fall into different partitions.
}
of the partition into equivalent-key groups produced by \tcode{Pred}.

\pnum
\indextext{unordered associative containers!iterators}%
The iterator types \tcode{iterator} and \tcode{const_iterator} of
an unordered associative container are of at least the forward iterator

the container prior to the insert operation, \tcode{n} is the

    \effects
    An insertion in the middle of the deque invalidates all the iterators and
    references to elements of the deque.

    \complexity
    The complexity is linear in the number of elements inserted plus the lesser
    of the distances to the beginning and end of the deque.

    and causes a single call to a constructor of

A
\tcode{vector}
is a sequence container that supports
(amortized) constant time insert and erase operations at the end;
insert and erase in the middle take linear time.
Storage management is handled automatically, though hints can be given
to improve efficiency.

\pnum
A \tcode{vector} meets all of the requirements of a container and of a
reversible container (given in two tables in~\ref{container.requirements}), of a
sequence container, including most of the optional sequence container
requirements\iref{sequence.reqmts}, of an allocator-aware container
(\tref{container.alloc.req}),
and, for an element type other than \tcode{bool},
of a contiguous container\iref{container.requirements.general}.
The exceptions are the
\tcode{push_front}, \added{\tcode{push\char`_front\char`_range}}, \tcode{pop_front}, and \tcode{emplace_front} member functions, which are not
provided. Descriptions are provided here only for operations on \tcode{vector}
that are not described in one of these tables or for operations where there is
additional semantic information.

    \pnum
    \remarks
    Causes reallocation if the new size is greater than the old capacity.
    Reallocation invalidates all the references, pointers, and iterators
    referring to the elements in the sequence, as well as the past-the-end iterator.
    If no reallocation happens, then
    references, pointers, and iterators
    before the insertion point remain valid
    but those at or after the insertion point,
    including the past-the-end iterator,
    are invalidated.
    If an exception is thrown other than by
    the copy constructor, move constructor,
    assignment operator, or move assignment operator of
    \tcode{T} or by any \tcode{InputIterator} operation
    there are no effects.

    \tcode{T} is \oldconcept{CopyInsertable} or \tcode{is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<T>}
    is \tcode{true}, there are no effects.
    Otherwise, if an exception is thrown by the move constructor of a non-\oldconcept{CopyInsertable}
    \tcode{T}, the effects are unspecified.

\indexlibraryglobal{priority_queue}%
Any sequence container with random access iterator and supporting operations
\tcode{front()},
\tcode{push_back()}
and
\tcode{pop_back()}
can be used to instantiate
\tcode{priority_queue}.
In particular,
\tcode{vector}\iref{vector}
and
\tcode{deque}\iref{deque}
can be used.
Instantiating
\tcode{priority_queue}
also involves supplying a function or function object for making
priority comparisons; the library assumes that the function or function
object defines a strict weak ordering\iref{alg.sorting}.

\pnum
The \tcode{from_range_t} struct is an empty class type used as a unique type to
disambiguate constructor and function overloading. Specifically, several types, notably containers have constructors with \tcode{from_range_t} as the first argument>

The range conversions functions efficiently construct an instance of type from a range.
\tcode{ranges::to<C>(r, args)} returns an instance \tcode{c} of \tcode{C} constructed by the first valid method among the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Construct \tcode{c} from r
\item Construct \tcode{c} from r using the tagged ranged constructor (\tcode{from_range_t})
\item Construct \tcode{c} from the pair of iterators \tcode{ranges::begin(r), ranges::end(r)}
\item Construct \tcode{c}, then insert each element of \tcode{r} at the end of \tcode{c}.
\item If \tcode{C} is a \tcode{range} whose value type is itself a \tcode{range} (and is not a \tcode{view}), and \tcode{r}'s value type is also a \tcode{range}, the application of \tcode{to<range_value_t<C>>} for each element of \tcode{r} is inserted
at the end of c.
\end{itemize}

When the instance \tcode{c} of \tcode{C} in constructed, the parameter pack \tcode{args} is forwarded as the trailing parameters of the selected
constructor of \tcode{C}. This allows passing an allocator to the selected constructor.

\section{Feature test macros}

Bump the value of \tcode{__cpp_lib_ranges} to the date of adoption.

Add a new macro in \tcode{<version>} \tcode{__cpp_lib_containers_ranges} set to the date of adoption.

The macro \tcode{__cpp_lib_containers_ranges} is also present in
<vector>, <list>, <forward_list> <map>, <set> <unordered_map>, <unordered_set>, <deque>, <queue>, <priority_queue>, <stack>, and <string>


\section{Implementation Experience}

Implementations of `ranges::to` are available in \cite{Range V3}, \cite{cmcstl2} and on Github \cite{rangesnext}.
The tagged ranges constructors, insert methods and other range-taking container members fuctions have \textbf{not} been
implemented.

\section{Related Paper and future work}

Future work is needed to allow constructing \tcode{std::array} from \EXPO{tiny-ranges}.
