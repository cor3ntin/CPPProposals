\section{Abstract}

C++ allows passing templates as template parameters.
However, they are forced to be typenames (either type alias templates or class templates).
Variable templates or concepts are not supported.
This is a hole in the template facilities and is the topic of this paper.

We introduce a way to pass concepts and variable templates as template parameters.

Example:

\begin{colorblock}
template<
   template <typename T> concept C,
   template <typename T> auto V
>
struct S{};

template <typename T>
concept Concept = true;

template <typename T>
constexpr auto Var = 42;

S<Concept, Var> s;
\end{colorblock}

Note: this paper is a subset of the larger \paper{P1985R3} (Universal Template Parameters); the authors felt this topic is subtle enough to warrant its own paper.

\section{Motivation}

Template template-parameters allow for higher-order templates and greater composability.
They can be used, for example, to parametrize a function that operates on any container of any type or to write CRTP-based interfaces.

C++23 limits template template-parameters to be class templates or an alias templates.
A variable template (C++14) or a concept (concepts are themselves templates) cannot be passed as a template argument in C++23.

The motivation for passing a concept as a template argument is very much the same as our reason for supporting class templates as template arguments: to allow higher-level constructs.

While there are workarounds - for example by wrapping a variable in a struct with a \tcode{value} member that can then be passed as a type template template parameter, these workarounds
all suffer the same limitations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item They have terrible ergonomics
    \item They have a noticeable impact on performance - instantiating types is expensive
    \item They do not allow to take advantage of nice concept properties such as terse syntax and subsumption.
\end{itemize}

All of these limitations of available patterns are additional motivations for this proposal.


Being able to define a concept adaptor, for instance, would be very nice:

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename T, template <typename> concept C>
concept decays_to = C<decay_t<T>>;
\end{colorblock}

Being able to use it with any concept constraint would also be helpful:

\begin{colorblock}
template <decays_to<copyable> T>
auto f(T&& x);
\end{colorblock}


Other such constructs might, for example, include the following.
\begin{itemize}
\item \tcode{range_of<Concept>}\\
    Many algorithms can operate on a sequence of integer or string-like types and while it is possible to express
    \tcode{range<T> \&\& SomeConcept<ranges::range_reference_t<R>>}, some codebases do that enough that they might want to have a shorter way to express that idea,
    one that would let them use the abbreviated syntax in more cases.

\item \tcode{tuple_of<Concept>} \\
    This follows the same idea, but expressing this idea in the require clause of each function or class that might need it would be an exercise in frustration and a maintenance nightmare. We explore a \tcode{tuple_of} concept later in this paper.
    Representing vectors as tuples-like things of numbers is common in the scientific community, and these scientific libraries have no ideal way to express these constraints.

\item Avoiding duplication.\\
    In his \href{https://brevzin.github.io/c++/2019/01/09/concept-templates/}{blog post} on this very topic, Barry Revzin observed that \tcode{std::ranges} defines a handful of concepts that are very
    similar to one another except they use different concepts internally. Concept template parameters can reduce a lot of duplication.
    Compare the \href{https://eel.is/c++draft/indirectcallable.indirectinvocable}{definitions in the Standard} and \href{https://godbolt.org/z/ohKsoKh9G}{the implementation with our proposal}.
\end{itemize}

To quote Barry's aforementioned blog post

\begin{quoteblock}
I’d rather write a one-line definition per metaconcept, not a one-line definition per metaconcept instantiation.
\end{quoteblock}

So part of the motivation for concept template-parameters is the same as for having functions, templates, and classes:
We want to be able to reuse code and to make it less repetitive and error-prone.


We also demonstrated how this feature can be leveraged to provide better diagnostics when a concept is not satisfied \href{https://compiler-explorer.com/z/sPz5faEbP}{[Compiler Explorer]}.


There is community interest in these features.
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63098070/is-it-possible-to-pass-a-concept-as-a-template-parameter}{Is it possible to pass a concept as a template parameter?}
\item \href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72488554/concept-to-assert-an-argument-is-another-concept-with-whatever-parameters}{Concept to assert an argument is another concept, with whatever parameters}

\end{itemize}

Unfortunately, this is one of those features that truly shows its power on large examples that don't tend to fit into papers.

\subsection{Variable-template template-parameters}

Variable-template template-parameters (previously proposed in \paper{P2008R0}) are useful by themselves.
They can be emulated with a template class with a static public \tcode{value} data member.
Most standard type traits are defined as a type and have an equivalent \tcode{_v} variable:

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename T, typename U>
constexpr bool is_same_v = is_same<T, U>::value;
\end{colorblock}

But this is not compile-time efficient: a class has to be instantiated in addition to generating the value for the constant, which is strictly more work than just producing the constant.
For a `bool` constant, for instance, the difference is substantial; on Apple clang15, it's about 60\% (so, less than half the time).
The memory footprint is more difficult to gauge, but it seems around a 40\% difference.

This performance issue is also explored in more detail in \paper{P1715R1}.

In other microbenchmarks, Gašper has observed a minimum of 30\% speedup by not instantiating class bodies, and a 50\% memory usage reduction for programs with heavy traits usage, specifically when implementing P2300-like classes.

Also, if one has multiple metaprogramming libraries, relying on idioms like \tcode{::value} is fundamentally less composable than a value just being a value.
Similarly, if you have a concept in your codebase, you shouldn't have to wrap it into a static constexpr \tcode{::value} member of a type to pass it to a metafunction.

Wrapping variables in class templates also adds complexity for users: The main reason we expose both a variable template and a class template for every boolean trait is that the language does not support variable-template template-parameters. (Note that we are aware of some codebases using traits as tags for dispatch but this is far from the common case.)

For instance, counting elements \tcode{Ts} that satisfy a specific predicate \tcode{p} could be done as

\begin{colorblock}
template <template <typename> auto p, typename... Ts>
constexpr std::size_t count_if_v = (... + p<Ts>);
\end{colorblock}

We could do the same thing with a type, but it incurs a class template instantiation for each element:

\begin{colorblock}
template <template <typename> typename p, typename... Ts>
constexpr std::size_t count_if_v = (... + p<Ts>::value);
\end{colorblock}

It will always be more work for the compiler to instantiate a whole class together with its body (not just its declaration) to allow access to the inner value member than just instantiating a variable template, no matter how much we try to optimize this pattern. \paper{p1715r1} makes the same case.

\section{Additional examples}

The authors have use cases that don't fit in the paper (typical for the most \emph{interesting} use cases) where type-based vs variable-based metaprogramming means the difference of 300s compile-times per unit vs. more than an hour (currently by textually duplicating definitions that could have been genericized if variable template template-parameters were available).

\subsection{Terse syntax, overloading, and reusing existing concepts}

The following example, simplified from production code shows multiple interesting properties of concept template parameters.

Here we demonstrate the algorithm \tcode{with_values_t} with \tcode{optional} and \tcode{expected}.
Its call operator applies \tcode{f} to all engaged arguments; however, all the arguments must be of the same shape (all \tcode{optional}s, all \tcode{expected}), etc.

To do that, we here use the abbreviated function template syntax with \tcode{type-constraints}, which is only possible with concept template parameters.

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename T>             struct optional;
template <typename V, typename E> struct expected;

template <typename> constexpr bool _some_maybe_v = false;
template <typename T> constexpr bool _some_maybe_v<optional<T>&>       = true;
template <typename T> constexpr bool _some_maybe_v<optional<T> const&> = true;
template <typename> constexpr bool _some_expected_v = false;
template <typename T, typename E> constexpr bool _some_expected_v<expected<T, E>&>       = true;
template <typename T, typename E> constexpr bool _some_expected_v<expected<T, E> const&> = true;

template <typename T>
concept some_maybe = _some_maybe_v<T&>;
template <typename T>
concept some_expected = _some_expected_v<T&>;

template <template <typename> concept C>
struct _with_values_t {
  static constexpr auto operator()(auto&& f, C auto&& v, C auto&& ... vs) -> decltype(auto) {
    if constexpr (sizeof...(vs) == 0) {
      if (v) {
        return f(*FWD(v));
      } else {
        return f();
      }
    } else {
      if (v) {
        return _with_values_t{}(bind_front(f, *FWD(v)), FWD(vs)...);
      } else {
        return _with_values_t{}(f, FWD(vs)...);
      }
  }
};

// Enforce it's the same monad
inline constexpr struct with_values_t : _with_values_t<some_maybe>, _with_values_t<some_either> {
  using _with_values_t<some_maybe>::operator();
  using _with_values_t<some_either>::operator();
} with_values {};
\end{colorblock}


It would be technically possible to use a type instead here

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename T>
struct some_expected_t {
    static constexpr bool value = some_expected<T>;
};

struct _with_values_t {
  template <typename First, typename... Tail>
      requires (some_expected_t<First>::value && (some_expected_t<Tail>::value && ...))
  static constexpr auto operator()(auto&& f, C auto&& e, C auto&& ... es) -> decltype(auto);
};
\end{colorblock}

But again:
\begin{itemize}
\item This is much less ergonomic as it forces users to wrap their concepts in types which is not intuitive (ie we have found that difficult to teach).
\item The necessity of introducing new names for the same predicate - just exposed as a type, concept, or variable - adds unnecessary complexity to APIs
\item Composability only works by convention.
\item Creating types has a significant performance impact on compile times
\item Diagnostic messages are slightly worse than they could be because of the added layers of wrapping and because compilers will decompose concepts in diagnostic messages.
\end{itemize}

A variant of this function is used in an implementation of the \tcode{upon_all_done(handle_successes, handle_failures, senders...)} sender transformer in one internal codebase,
where \tcode{handle_successes} is invoked with all the successful completions, and \tcode{handle_failures} with all errors.

% when_all_nmap(handle_successes, handle_failures, senders...); // we're *actually* doing this on result<> types, not optionals. result = variant<set_value(...)..., set_error(...)..., set_stopped()>

\subsection{When life gives you Lambdas}

To work around the lack of concept parameters, users have started to use generic lambdas

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename T, auto ConceptWrapperLambda>
concept decays_to = requires {
    ConceptWrapperLambda.template operator()<std::decay_t<T>>();
};
template <class T>
requires decays_to<T, ([]<std::copyable>(){})>
auto f(T&& x) {}
\end{colorblock}

Here the concepts we want to parametrize on are passed as a constrained generic lambda - which we then try to call when checking our higher-level concepts.
This allows not to have to create a new type for each concept, so it might be slightly easier to use, although the reader will agree that it particularly arcane.
In addition to the usability concerns, lambdas are never a solution to compile times performance.

All the existing work arounds suffer similar performance and usability concerns, and of course none support subsumption.
Yet, many such workarounds have been developed and a number of them have been deployed in production.
Daisy Hollman provided an \href{https://p2841.godbolt.org/z/efYK1crb3}{entire collection of such workarounds}.

\pagebreak

%\subsection{Mixins}
%
%In this other example adapted from production code, We have a mixin container that has a \tcode{get_mixin<concept>} utility that
%returns the reference to the mixed-in type that implements that concept. Currently, we emulate it with the horrible constrained lambda trick.
%
%\begin{colorblock}
%template <typename facade>
%struct utils {
%  auto& self() & { return static_cast<facade&>(*this); }
%
%  template <template <typename> concept C>
%  auto _get_mixin() -> auto& {
%    return  self().template _get_mixin<C>();
%  }
%};
%
%template <typename... Mixins>
%struct facade : Mixins<utils<facade>>... {
%  template <template <typename> concept C>
%  auto& _get_mixin() {
%    using return_t = select_first_t<C, Mixins...>;
%    return static_cast<return_t&>(*this);
%  }
%};
%
%// and you want users to do stuff like
%template <typename X>
%concept exchange_handler = requires (X x, order o) {
%  x.send_order(o);
%  { x.decode_order(std::byte const*); } -> an_order;
%};
%\end{colorblock}
%
%There is no way to turn this concept into a type-trait in this mixin library, and there's no way to teach users to make concepts like \tcode{exchange_handler},
%unless we teach them that they have to lift the type themselves, with a different name.

\subsection{Previous work}

Variable-template template-parameters were proposed in \paper{P2008R0} and were part of the original design for variable templates \paper{N3615}.
Concept template-parameters have been described by Barry Revzin (back when Concept names were uppercase) in his blog \href{https://brevzin.github.io/c++/2019/01/09/concept-templates/}{here} and \href{https://brevzin.github.io/c++/2019/03/24/concept-templates-2/}{here}.
We mentioned them in \paper{P2632R0} and \paper{P1985R3}.

\subsection{Universal template-parameters}

The fact that variable-template template-parameters and concept template-parameters appear in the same papers is not accidental.
For a universal template-parameter to be universal, we need to make sure it covers the set of entities we could want to use as template-parameters.
There is, therefore, an important order of operations.
If we were to add universal template-parameters before concept template-parameters and variable-template template-parameters, we would be in a situation where either
\begin{itemize}
\item we can't ever add concept template-parameters and variable-template template-parameters
\item "universal template-parameters would not be truly universal"
\item we would feel forced to come up with some kind of "more universal template-parameter" syntax
\end{itemize}

None of these outcomes seems desirable; therefore, the best course of action is to ensure that we
support as best we can the full set of entities we might ever want to support as template-parameters, before adding support for universal template-parameters.

\section{Design}

\subsection{Syntax}

We propose the following syntax for the declaration of a template head accepting a concept as a parameter:

\begin{colorblock}
template<
    template <@\placeholder{template-parameter-list}@> concept C
>
\end{colorblock}

We propose the following syntax for the declaration of a template head accepting a variable template as parameter:

\begin{colorblock}
template<
    template <@\placeholder{template-parameter-list}@> auto C
>
\end{colorblock}

Note that because variable templates and their type can be arbitrarily specialized, \tcode{auto} here acts
only as a syntactic marker and cannot be replaced by a \grammarterm{type-id}.

This forms a natural, somewhat intuitive extension of the existing syntax for template extension:
\begin{colorblock}
template<
    typename T,
    auto V,
    template <@\placeholder{template-parameter-list}@> typename TT,
    template <@\placeholder{template-parameter-list}@> auto VT,
    template <@\placeholder{template-parameter-list}@> concept C,
>
\end{colorblock}

\subsection{Default Arguments}

Like type template template parameters, concepts, and variable template template
parameters can have a default argument that is a concept name or the name of a variable template respectively.
Packs can't be defaulted. (That's a separate paper!)

\subsection{Usage}

Within the definition of a templated entity, a concept template-parameter
can be used anywhere a concept name can be used, including as a type constraint, in the requires clause, and so forth.

For example, the following should be valid:

\begin{colorblock}
template <template <typename T> concept C>
struct S {
    void f(C auto);

};
\end{colorblock}

\subsection{Concept template-parameters and subsumption}

Consider:
\begin{colorblock}
template <typename T>
requires view<T> && input_range<T>
void f(); // #1

template <typename T>
requires view<T> && contiguous_range<T>
void f(); // #2
\end{colorblock}

We expect \#2 to be more specialized than \#1 because \tcode{contiguous_range} subsumes\\
\tcode{input_range}.

Now, consider:

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename T>
requires all_of<T, view, input_range>
void f(); // #1

template <typename T>
requires all_of<T, view, contiguous_range>
void f(); // #2
\end{colorblock}

[\href{https://compiler-explorer.com/z/71qjW1WWP}{Run this example on Compiler Explorer}]

This example ought to be isomorphic to the previous one, and \#2 should still be more specialized than \#1.
To do that, we need to be able to substitute concept template arguments in constraint expressions when normalizing constraints.

When establishing subsumption, we have historically not substituted template arguments, instead establishing a mapping of template parameters to arguments for each
constraint and comparing those mappings.

But to establish subsumption rules for concept template-parameters, we need to depart from that somewhat.

Concepts have the particularity of never being explicitly specialized, deduced, dependent, or even instantiated.
Substituting a concept template argument is only a matter of replacing the corresponding template parameter with the list of constraints of the substituted
concept, recursively.

As such, subsumption for concept template-parameters does not violate the guiding principle of subsumption.

For example, a \tcode{range_of_integrals} defined as follow:

\begin{colorblock}
template<typename T>
concept range_of_integrals = std::ranges::range<T> && @\textbf{std::integral}@<std::remove_cvref_t<std::ranges::range_reference_t<T>>>;
\end{colorblock}

Can be mechanically lifted:

\begin{colorblock}
template<typename T, template <typename...> concept C>
concept range_of = std::ranges::range<T> && @\textbf{C}@<std::remove_cvref_t<std::ranges::range_reference_t<T>>>;
template<typename T>
concept range_of_integrals = range_of<T, @\textbf{std::integral}@>;
\end{colorblock}

Note that this transformation does not change any other behavior of normalization, i.e., concept template-parameters that appear within other atomic constraints
are not substituted, and arguments that are not concept names are not substituted either.

\subsection{Fold expressions involving concept template-parameters}

Our proposed design allow for subsumption in the the presence of fold expressions whose pattern is a concept.
(For the non-concept case, see \paper{P2963R0})


\begin{colorblock}
template <
    typename T,
    template <typename...> concept... C>
concept all_of = (C<T> && ...);
\end{colorblock}

Once substituted, the sequence of binary \tcode{\&\&} or \tcode{||} is normalized,
\tcode{all_of}, \tcode{any_of}, and so on can then be implemented in a way that supports subsumption.

One very important case where this facility is absolutely essential is constraining tuples (and other algebraic data-types) by dimension:

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename X, template <typename> concept... C>
concept product_type_of = (... && C<std::tuple_element_t<C...[?], X>>);
//   index-of-current-element, not proposed, but needed  ~~~~~~~
\end{colorblock}

\paper{P2632R0} discusses alternatives to the awful index-of-current-element syntax above.

\subsection{ADL}

Similar to variables, variable templates and concepts are not associated entities when performing argument-dependent lookup.
This is consistent with previous work (for example \paper{N3595} and \paper{P0934R0}) and the general consensus toward ADL.

\subsection{Deduction of concept and template parameters}

Variable and concept template-parameters should be deducible from a template argument of a class template, used in the argument list of a function.

\begin{colorblock}
template <template <class> auto V, template <class> concept C>
struct A {}; // A takes a variable template template argument

template <template <class T> auto V, template <class> concept C>
void foo(A<V, C>);  // can accept any specialization of A; V and C are deduced

template <class T>
auto Var = 0;

template <class T>
concept Concept = true;

void test() {
    foo(A<Var, Concept>{});
}
\end{colorblock}

[\href{https://compiler-explorer.com/z/66dr6fnKj}{Run this example on Compiler Explorer}]

\section{Partial ordering of function templates involving concept template parameters}

Let us introduce three concepts that refine eachother \tcode{A}, \tcode{B}, and \tcode{C},
as well as a class template \tcode{S} that carries a concept \tcode{X} and a type \tcode{T}.

If we then define an overload set of two functions where one deduces the concept,
we get into an interesting situation where, if concept parameters were allowed participate in partial ordering, the choice of template arguments of \tcode{S} could change the subsumption order.

\begin{colorblock}
template <template <typename T> concept X, typename T>
struct S {};
template <typename T>
concept A = true;
template <typename T>
concept B = true && A<T>;
template <typename T>
concept C = true && B<T>;

template <template <typename T>  concept X, typename T>
int answer(S<X, T>) requires B<T> { return 42; }
template <template <typename T> concept X, typename T>
int answer(S<X, T>) requires X<T> { return 43; }

answer(S<A, int>{});
answer(S<C, int>{});
answer(S<B, int>{});

\end{colorblock}


In a previous version of this proposal, we proposed that the concept template argument (\tcode{A}, \tcode{B}, \tcode{C} respectively)
would be substituted in each viable \tcode{answer overload} before determining partial ordering.

However, historically, it was always possible to determine the partial ordering of two function templates before substitution, and independently
of any template argument. This has notably allowed compilers to cache partial orderings of function templates, and even though the compiler isn't confused, one might legitimately be concerned that the users might be.
On the face of it, it seems valuable for a C++ programmer to be able to partially order function templates in their head,
and this feature seems to allow a corner-case where that is impossible before substitution.

It was always the position of the authors that use cases where concepts are deduced from functions arguments were contrived but
we did not want to outright limit the set of places were a concept template parameter could be used,
and it took us a while to find a reasonable way to resolve these opposite design goals.

Ultimately we found a solution that preserves all the uses cases this feature was designed for,
while not making partial ordering dependent on arguments.

The rule we are proposing is:

\textbf{Given a template declaration \tcode{D} with a concept parameter \tcode{C}, if \tcode{C} appears in the associated constraints of \tcode{D}, then \tcode{D} is never at least as constrained as another constrained declaration.}
In the example above, the 3 calls to \tcode{answer} are, with is rule, ambiguous.

This rule makes any overload that references a concept template parameter in its requires clause unorderable solely based on subsumption.


We think this has nice properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It's fairly straightforward to teach
    \item It's easy to produce a good diagnosis for.
    \item It leaves the design space open.
\end{itemize}

Consider this slightly different example:

\begin{colorblock}
template <template <typename> concept C>
concept A = C<int>;
template <template <typename> concept C>
concept B = true && A<C>;

template <template <typename T> concept X>
void f() {}; // #1
template <template <typename T> concept X>
void f() requires A<X> {} // #2
template <template <typename T> concept X>
void f() requires B<X> {} // #3

template <typename T>
concept Foo = true;

f<Foo>(); // #4 (ambiguous between 2 and 3)
\end{colorblock}

Here, \#2 and \#3 are more specialized than \#1 (because they are constrained and \#1 is not).

With the rule proposed above, neither \#2 or \#3 are as least as constrained as each other (as they refer to a concept templaste parameter \tcode{X}).
As such \#2 is not more specialized than \#3 and \#3 is not more specialized than \#2, and the call \#4 is ambiguous.

We could conceive an alternative design instead, such that we would \textbf{consider dependent \tcode{concept-id} (ie dependent on a concept template parameter of the function template) to be atomic constraints} (option 2).

With that alternative design, for the example above the associated constraints of \#2 would be, after normalization \tcode{C<int>} (where \tcode{C<int>} is an atomic constraint and \tcode{C} refers to some invented template argument), and the associated constraints of \#3 would be, after normalization \tcode{true \&\& C<int>} (where \tcode{C<int>} is the same expression as \#2's).

In that model, \#3 subsumes \#2 and the call is not ambiguous.
The key observation is that, the nature of \tcode{C} does not affect subsumption whether it would be substituted or not.

Not looking at template arguments (and considering dependent \tcode{concept-id}) can lead to situations where
overloads are ambiguous, when they would not be if the concept argument was written verbatim and not passed via a parameter.

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename T>
concept Foo = true;

template <template <typename> concept C>
concept B = true && C<int>;

template <template <typename T> concept X>
void f() requires Foo<int>{}; // #1

template <template <typename T> concept X>
void f() requires B<X> {} // #2

f<Foo>(); // ambiguous between #1 and #2
\end{colorblock}

The opposite is not possible.

There is a compromise between these two options. We could consider
that a concept that appears (either as concept-id, or as concept template argument of another concept-id) in a subexpression of \tcode{\&\&} or \tcode{||}
makes that subexpression atomic (and that subexpression only).

\begin{colorblock}
template <template <typename> concept X>
concept AlwaysTrue = true; // X is not used
template <typename T>
concept A = true;
template <typename T, template <typename> concept C>
void f(T) requires
A<T>
|| C<int>  // atomic (depends on C)
|| AlwaysTrue<T, C> {}  // atomic (depends on C, even if C is never used by AlwaysTrue)
\end{colorblock}

This would be less restrictive than Option 1, and less precise than Option 2, but easier to implement.
Lets refer to this option as 1B.

In no case do we expand concept template arguments when considering subsumption; the question is merely about how much subsumption depth we want to preserve, that is, how much rope for resolving ambiguity do we want to give users.

Ultimately, while whe have a slight preference for option 1.

In the previous revision of this paper, EWG was asked to choose between these options:

\begin{itemize}
\item Option  1: Don't try to determine a more constrained overload at all in the presence of a referenced concept template parameter.
\item Option 1B: Before normalization (ie at the top level), if a concept template parameter is referenced in the subexpression of of a logical \&\& or ||, consider that subexpression atomic
\item Option 2:  After normalization of non-dependent concept-id, consider concept-id refering to a concept template parameter to be atomic constraints.
(Option 1 and 1B can be evolved into option 2 later, the opposite would be a breaking change.)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{EWG chose the first option.}

After CWG review in St Louis and \href{https://lists.isocpp.org/ext/2024/10/23412.php}{concertation on the EWG reflector}, the same logic is applied to
concept template parameters of enclosing templates, with the same motivation.

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename T>
concept A = true;

template <typename T>
concept B = A<T> && true;

template <template <typename> concept Class1,
          template <typename> concept Class2>
struct S {
     static constexpr int g(Class1 auto) {return 1;} // # 5
     static constexpr int g(Class2 auto) {return 2;} // # 6
};
static_assert(S<A, B>::g(1) == 2); // ambiguous?
\end{colorblock}


\subsection{Deduction of template parameters from the argument list of a variable template argument}

This is not proposed.

Consider:

\begin{colorblock}
    template<template <typename...> auto, auto>
    inline constexpr bool is_specialization_of_v = false;

    template<
    template <typename...> auto v,
    typename... Args
    >
    inline constexpr bool is_specialization_of_v<v, v<Args...>> = true; // #2

    template <typename T>
    constexpr int i = 42;

    static_assert(is_specialization_of_v<i, i<int>>); // #3
\end{colorblock}

\href{https://godbolt.org/z/sqTfEojh4}{[Compiler Explorer]}


Should we be able to deduce \tcode{Args} from \tcode{int}?
Some existing implementations will eagerly substitute \tcode{i<int>} by its value (here, \tcode{42}),
such that there is subsequently nothing left to deduce \tcode{Args} against.

While it would be possible to make that work, the implementation effort is non-negligible and the benefits limited,
as we could only deduce the arguments of entities that are valid template arguments - which sounds obvious but that means that the
above example can only work on a subset of variables (constexpr variables template specialization of structural types).

We would also need to decide whether \tcode{is_specialization_of_v<i, i<int>>} behaves differently from \tcode{is_specialization_of_v<i, (i<int>)>}
and how that generalizes to arbitrary subexpressions involving variable template specializations.

So, for now, arguments of variable template template parameters are not deduced.
instead, we should make \#2 ill-formed, so that we have the opportunity to extend that at a later time if we find sufficient motivation for it.

There are existing cases where we make non-deductible partial specializations ill-formed (see \href{https://eel.is/c++draft/temp.spec.partial#match-3}{[temp.spec.partial.match])},
however in the general case we don't seem to (\href{https://gcc.godbolt.org/z/fv1e8nnsf}{for example here is an example with a non-deducible pack})


\subsection{Equivalence of atomic constraints}

One interesting concept to consider is \tcode{tuple_of}, which would e.g., allow constraining a function on a \placeholder{tuple-like}
of integrals, a frequent use case in scientific computation.

In the absence of member and alias packs, a \tcode{tuple_like} concept could look like

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename T, int N>
constexpr bool __tuple_check_elements = [] {
    if constexpr (N == 0)
      return true;
    else if constexpr(requires (T t) {
        typename std::tuple_element_t<N-1, T>;
        { std::get<N-1>(t) };
    })
      return  __tuple_check_elements<T, N-1>;
    return false;
}();

template <typename T>
concept tuple_like = requires {
    typename std::tuple_size<T>::type;
} &&  __tuple_check_elements<T, std::tuple_size_v<T>>;
\end{colorblock}

Here, we use a constexpr variable template to check the constraint on individual elements.
We can trivially adapt this code to take a concept argument:

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename T, template <typename> concept C>
concept decays_to = C<std::decay_t<T>>;

template <typename T, int N, template <typename> concept C>
constexpr bool __tuple_check_elements = [] {
    if constexpr (N == 0)
      return true;
    else if constexpr(requires (T t) {
        typename std::tuple_element_t<N-1, T>;
        { std::get<N-1>(t) } -> decays_to<C>;
    })
      return  __tuple_check_elements<T, N-1, C>;
    return false;
}();

template <typename T, template <typename> concept C>
concept tuple_of = requires {
    typename std::tuple_size<T>::type;
} &&  __tuple_check_elements<T, std::tuple_size_v<T>, C>;
\end{colorblock}

And this works fine, but \tcode{__tuple_check_elements} is an atomic constraint, so we cannot
establish a subsumption relationship for this concept.

With a sufficient number of pack features, we could probably write a concept that checks all elements with a single constraint,
i.e.,

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename T, typename E, int N, template <typename> concept C>
concept __tuple_of_element = requires (T t) {
    typename std::tuple_element_t<N, T>;
    { std::get<N>(t) } -> decays_to<C>;
} &&  C<std::tuple_element_t<0, T>>;

template <typename T, template <typename> concept C>
concept tuple_of = requires {
    typename std::tuple_size<T>::type;
} &&  (__tuple_of_element<T, T::[:], current_expansion_index_magic(), C> && ...);
\end{colorblock}

But in addition to relying on imaginary features, this is pretty inefficient since ordering complexity would be proportional to the square of the number of tuple elements.

Fortunately, while checking satisfaction does require looking at every element, we can look at just one element to establish subsumption in this particular case.

We can rewrite our concept as

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename T, int N, template <typename> concept C>
concept __tuple_of_element = requires (T t) {
    typename std::tuple_element_t<N, T>;
    { std::get<N>(t) } -> decays_to<C>;
} &&  C<std::tuple_element_t<0, T>>;

template <typename T, int N, template <typename> concept C>
constexpr bool __check_tuple_elements = [] {
    if constexpr (N == 1)
        return true;
    else if constexpr(__tuple_of_element<T, N-1, C>)
        return  __check_tuple_elements<T, N-1, C>;
    return false;
}();

template <typename T, template <typename> concept C>
concept tuple_of = requires {
    typename std::tuple_size<T>::type;
} &&  (std::tuple_size_v<T>  == 0 || (
         // Check the first element with a concept to establish subsumption
        __tuple_of_element<T, 0, C> &&
        // Check constraint satisfaction for subsequent elements
        __check_tuple_elements<T, std::tuple_size_v<T>, C>
));
\end{colorblock}

[\href{https://compiler-explorer.com/z/n6nsdj37j}{Run this example on Compiler Explorer}]

For this to work, the concept template-parameter C needs to be substituted
in the concept \tcode{__tuple_of_element} but not in the atomic constraint
\tcode{__check_tuple_elements<T, std::tuple_size_v<T>, C>}.

Atomic constraints also need to ignore concept template-parameters for the purpose
of comparing their template arguments when establishing atomic constraint equivalence during subsumption.


\section{Status of this proposal and further work}

Our main priority should be to make progress on some form of universal template parameters.

This paper has been implemented in an experimental version of clang, available on godbolt.

Before that, we need to ensure concepts and variable-template template-parameters are supported features so that universal
template-parameters support the gamut of entities that could reasonably be used as template-parameters.

As part of that, subsumption for concept template-parameters, as proposed in this paper, as well as subsumption of fold expressions
should be considered an integral part of the design since adding them later might be somewhat challenging, although it should not affect existing valid code.

%\section{Things to be careful about}
%
%Concepts have carefully designed limitations aimed to make subsumption possible and reasonably efficient.
%Care has to be taken not to change that.
%
%In particular, specialization of concepts is not allowed nor is declaring concepts in classes or other non-global (potentially dependent)
%contexts.
%
%Concept template-parameters need to be substituted when evaluating constraints, but other arguments do not.
%Efficient memoization is still possible by caching concept template arguments (and only concept template arguments) along the concept.
%
%%Concept template-parameters do not allow a concept to refer to itself, i.e., recursion.
%%Universal template-parameters may allow recursion.
%%
%%\begin{colorblock}
%%template <typename T, universal template C, typename...Args>
%%concept Y = C<T, C, Args...>;
%%
%%template <typename T, template <typename...> Concept , typename...Args>
%%concept Foo = Concept<T, Concept, Args...>;
%%
%%static_assert(Y<int, Foo>);
%%\end{colorblock}
%%
%%This will need careful consideration, but we have options, such as preventing the same concept name from appearing multiple times
%%or having an implementation-defined limit for how many concepts can be replaced during subsumption.

\section{Implementation}


The paper as proposed has been implemented in a fork of Clang and is available on compiler-explorer.
The implementation revealed no particular challenge. In particular, we confirmed that the proposed changes
do not prevent memoization for subsumption and satisfiability, i.e., a concept and the set of its concept parameters
are what needs to be cached.

For each argument type \tcode{T} in the function call,

the types of the function arguments
(and any \changed{template}{type template

Any \grammarterm{typedef-name}s and \grammarterm{using-declaration}{s}
used to specify the types
do not contribute to this set.
The set of entities
is determined in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If \tcode{T} is a fundamental type, its associated set of
    entities is empty.

    \item If \tcode{T} is a class type (including unions),
    its associated entities are:
    the class itself;
    the class of which it is a member, if any;
    and its direct and indirect base classes.
    Furthermore, if \tcode{T} is a class template specialization,
    its associated entities also include:
    the entities
    associated with the types of the template arguments
    provided for template type parameters;
    the templates used as \added{type} template template arguments; and

    arguments are members.
    \begin{note}
        Constant template arguments\added{, variable template template arguments, and concept template arguments} do not
        contribute to the set of associated entities.
    \end{note}

    \item If \tcode{T} is an enumeration type,
    its associated entities are \tcode{T}
    and, if it is a class member, the member's class.

    \item If \tcode{T} is a pointer to \tcode{U} or an array of \tcode{U},
    its associated entities are those associated with \tcode{U}.

    \item If \tcode{T} is a function type, its associated
    entities are those associated with the function parameter types and those
    associated with the return type.

    \item If \tcode{T} is a pointer to a member function of a class
    \tcode{X}, its associated entities are those associated
    with the function parameter types and return type, together with those
    associated with \tcode{X}.

    associated entities are those associated with the member
    type together with those associated with \tcode{X}.

In addition, if the argument is an overload set or the address of such a set,
its associated entities
are the union of those associated with each of the
members of the set, i.e., the entities associated with its
parameter types and return type.
Additionally, if the aforementioned overload set is named with
a \grammarterm{template-id}, its associated entities also include
its \added{type} template template arguments and

\rSec3[temp.constr.concept]{Concept-dependent constraints}

A \defn{concept-dependent constraint} \tcode{CD} is an atomic constraint whose
expression is a concept-id CI whose \grammarterm{concept-name} names a dependent concept named \tcode{C}.

To determine if \tcode{CD} is satisfied, the parameter mapping and template arguments are first substituted into \tcode{C}. If substitution results in an invalid concept-id in the immediate context of the constraint ([temp.deduct.general]), the constraint is not satisfied.
Otherwise, let \tcode{CI'} be the normal form of the concept-id after substitution of \tcode{C}.

\begin{note}
Normalization of \tcode{CI} may be ill-formed; no diagnostics is required.
\end{note}

To form \tcode{CI''}, each appearance of \tcode{C}'s template parameters in the parameter mappings of the atomic constraints (including concept-dependent constraints) in \tcode{CI'} is substituted with their respective arguments from the
the parameter mapping of \tcode{CD} and the arguments of \tcode{CI}.

%
%Each argument in the parameter mapping of CI'
%is substituted for the respective template parameter
%in the parameter mapping of CD.

The constraint is satisfied if \tcode{CI''} is satisfied.

\begin{note}
Checking whether \tcode{CI''} is satisfied can lead to further
normalization of concept-dependent constraints.
\end{note}


\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
template <typename>
concept C = true;

template <typename T, template <typename> concept CC>
concept D = CC<T>;

template <typename T,
                  template <typename> concept CT,
                  template <typename, template <typename> concept> concept CU
>
int f() requires CU<T, CT>;

int _ = f<int, C, D>(); // \#1
\end{codeblock}
In this example, the associated constraint of \tcode{f} is a concept-dependent constraint
$CI$ whose expression is the concept-id \tcode{CU<T, CT>}
with the mapping $\tcode{T} \mapsto \tcode{T}$,
                              $\tcode{CT} \mapsto \tcode{CT}$,
                              $\tcode{CU} \mapsto \tcode{CU}$.
                              .

$CI'$ is the result of substituting \tcode{D} into $CI$.

We consider the normal form $CI''$ of \tcode{D<T, CT>}, which is \tcode{CC<T>}
with the mapping $\tcode{T} \mapsto \tcode{T}$, $\tcode{CC} \mapsto \tcode{CC}$.

By recursion, \tcode{C} is substituted in \tcode{CC<T>} and then normalized to the atomic constraint \tcode{true},
which is satisfied.

template argument deduction \iref{temp.deduct} may identify

\pnum
Partial ordering selects which of two function templates is more
specialized than the other by transforming each template in turn
(see next paragraph) and performing template argument deduction
using the function type.
The deduction process determines whether
one of the templates is more specialized than the other. If so, the
more specialized template is the one chosen by the partial ordering
process.
If both deductions succeed, the partial ordering selects
the more constrained template (if one exists) as determined below.
