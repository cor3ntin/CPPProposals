\section{Abstract}

C++ allows passing templates as template parameters.
It does not, however, support these template template-parameters to be non-types, i.e., either variables or concepts, which
represents a hole in the template facilities and is the topic of this paper.

\section{Motivation}

Template template-parameters allow for higher-order templates and greater composability.
They can be used, for example, to parametrize a function that operates on any container of any type or to write CRTP-based interfaces.

C++23 limits template template-parameters to be class templates or alias templates.
A variable template (C++14) or a concept (concepts are themselves templates) cannot be passed as a template argument in C++23.

The motivation for passing a concept as a template argument is very much the same as our reason for supporting class templates as template arguments: to allow higher-level constructs.

Being able to define a concept adaptor, for instance, would be very nice:

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename T, template <typename> concept C>
concept decays_to = C<decay_t<T>>;
\end{colorblock}

Being able to use it with any concept constraint would also be helpful:

\begin{colorblock}
template <decays_to<copyable> T>
auto f(T&& x);
\end{colorblock}


Other such constructs might, for example, include the following.
\begin{itemize}
\item \tcode{range_of}\\
    Many algorithms can operate on a sequence of integer or string-like types and while it is possible to express
    \tcode{range<T> \&\& SomeConcept<ranges::range_reference_t<R>>}, some codebases do that enough that they might want to have a shorter way to express that idea,
    one that would let them use the abbreviated syntax in more cases.

\item \tcode{tuple_of} \\
    This follows the same idea, but expressing this idea in the require clause of each function or class that might need it would be an exercise in frustration and a maintenance nightmare. We explore a \tcode{tuple_of} concept later in this paper.
    Representing vectors as tuples-like things of numbers is common in the scientific community, and these scientific libraries have no ideal way to express these constraints.

\item Avoiding duplication.\\
     In his \href{https://brevzin.github.io/c++/2019/01/09/concept-templates/}{blog post} on this very topic, Barry Revzin observed that \tcode{std::ranges} defines a handful of concepts that are very
     similar to one another except they use different concepts internally. Concept template-parameters can reduce a lot of duplication.
     Compare the \href{https://eel.is/c++draft/indirectcallable.indirectinvocable}{definitions in the Standard} and \href{https://godbolt.org/z/ohKsoKh9G}{the implementation with our proposal}.
\end{itemize}

To quote Barry's aforementioned blog post
\begin{quoteblock}
I’d rather write a one-line definition per metaconcept, not a one-line definition per metaconcept instantiation.
\end{quoteblock}

So part of the motivation for concept template-parameters is the same motivation  we have for functions, templates, and classes:
We want to be able to reuse code and to make it less repetitive and error-prone.


We also demonstrated how this feature can be leveraged to provide better diagnostics when a concept is not satisfied \href{https://compiler-explorer.com/z/sPz5faEbP}{[Compiler Explorer]}.


There is community interest in these features.
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63098070/is-it-possible-to-pass-a-concept-as-a-template-parameter}{Is it possible to pass a concept as a template parameter?}

\end{itemize}

Unfortunately, this is one of those features that truly shows its power on large examples that don't tend to fit into papers.


\subsection{Variable-template template-parameters}

Variable-template template-parameters (previously proposed in \paper{P2008R0}) are arguably less useful.
They can be emulated with a template class with a static public \tcode{value} data member.
Most standard type traits are defined as a type and have an equivalent \tcode{_v} variable:
\begin{colorblock}
template <typename T, typename U>
constexpr bool is_same_v = is_same<T, U>::value;
\end{colorblock}

But this is not compile-time efficient: A class has to be instantiated, which is usually slow on most implementations.
Then we still need to instantiate the variable. This performance issue is explored in more detail in \paper{P1715R1}.

Wrapping variables in class templates also adds complexity for users: The main reason we expose both a variable template and a class template for every boolean
trait is because the language does not support variable-template template-parameters. (Note that we are aware of some codebases using traits as tags for dispatch but this far from the common case.)

For instance, counting elements that satisfy a specific predicate could be done as

\begin{colorblock}
template <template <typename> auto p, typename... Ts>
std::size_t count_if_v = (... + p<Ts>);
\end{colorblock}

We could do the same thing with a type, but it incurs a class template instantiation for each element:

\begin{colorblock}
template <template <typename> typename p, typename... Ts>
std::size_t count_if_v = (... + p<Ts>::value);
\end{colorblock}

It will always be more work for the compiler to instantiate a whole class together with its body (not just its declaration) to allow access to the inner value member than just instantiating a variable template, no matter how much we try to optimize this pattern. \paper{P1715R1} makes the same case.

The authors have use cases that don't fit in the paper (typical for the most \emph{interesting} use cases) where type-based vs variable-based metaprogramming means the difference of 300s compile-times per unit vs. more than an hour (currently by textually duplicating definitions that could have been genericized if variable template template-parameters were available).

\subsection{Previous works}

Variable-template template-parameters were proposed in \paper{P2008R0} and were part of the original design for variable templates \paper{N3615}.
Concept template-parameters have been described by Barry Revzin (back when Concept names were uppercase) in his blog \href{https://brevzin.github.io/c++/2019/01/09/concept-templates/}{here} and \href{https://brevzin.github.io/c++/2019/03/24/concept-templates-2/}{here}.
We mentioned them in \paper{P2632R0} and \paper{P1985R3}.

\subsection{Universal template-parameters}

The fact that variable-template template-parameters and concept template-parameters appear in the same papers is not accidental.
For a universal template-parameter to be universal, we need to make sure it covers the set of entities we could possibly want to ever use as template-parameters.
There is, therefore, an important order of operations.
If we were to add universal template-parameters before concept template-parameters and variable-template template-parameters, we would be in a situation where either
\begin{itemize}
\item we can't ever add concept template-parameters and variable-template template-parameters
\item "universal template-parameters would not be truly universal"
\item we would feel forced to come up with some kind of "more universal template-parameter" syntax
\end{itemize}

None of these outcomes seems desirable; therefore, the best course of action is to ensure that we
support as best we can the full set of entities we might ever want to support as template-parameters, before adding support for universal template-parameters.

\section{Design}

\subsection{Syntax}

We propose the following syntax for the declaration of a template head accepting a concept as parameter:

\begin{colorblock}
template<
    template <@\placeholder{template-parameter-list}@> concept C
>
\end{colorblock}

We propose the following syntax for the declaration of a template head accepting a variable template as parameter:

\begin{colorblock}
template<
    template <@\placeholder{template-parameter-list}@> auto C
>
\end{colorblock}

This forms a natural, somewhat intuitive extension of the existing syntax for template extension:
\begin{colorblock}
template<
    typename T,
    auto V,
    template <@\placeholder{template-parameter-list}@> typename TT,
    template <@\placeholder{template-parameter-list}@> auto VT,
    template <@\placeholder{template-parameter-list}@> concept C,
>
\end{colorblock}

\subsection{Default Arguments}

Like type template template parameters, concepts, and variable template template
parameters can have a default argument that is a concept name or the name of a variable template respectively.
Packs can't be defaulted. (That's a separate paper!)

\subsection{Usage}

Within the definition of a templated entity, a concept template-parameter
can be used anywhere a concept name can be used, including as a type constraint, in the requires clause, and so forth.

For example, the following should be valid:

\begin{colorblock}
template <template <typename T> concept C>
struct S {
    void f(C auto);

};
\end{colorblock}

\subsection{Concept template-parameters and subsumption}

Consider:
\begin{colorblock}
template <typename T>
requires view<T> && input_range<T>
void f(); // #1

template <typename T>
requires view<T> && contiguous_range<T>
void f(); // #2
\end{colorblock}

We expect \#2 to be more specialized than \#1 because \tcode{contiguous_range} subsumes\\
\tcode{input_range}.

Now, consider:

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename T>
requires all_of<T, view, input_range>
void f(); // #1

template <typename T>
requires all_of<T, view, contiguous_range>
void f(); // #2
\end{colorblock}

[\href{https://compiler-explorer.com/z/71qjW1WWP}{Run this example on Compiler Explorer}]

This example ought to be isomorphic to the previous one, and \#2 should still be more specialized than \#1.
To do that, we need to be able to substitute concept template arguments in constraint expressions when normalizing constraints.

When establishing subsumption, we have historically not substituted template arguments, instead establishing a mapping of template parameters to arguments for each
constraint and comparing those mappings.

But to establish subsumption rules for concept template-parameters, we need to depart from that somewhat.

Concepts have the particularity of never being explicitly specialized, deduced, dependent, or even instantiated.
Substituting a concept template argument is only a matter of replacing the corresponding template parameter with the list of constraints of the substituted
concept, recursively.

As such, subsumption for concept template-parameters does not violate the guiding principle of subsumption.

\begin{colorblock}
template<typename T, template <typename...> concept C>
concept range_of = std::ranges::range<T> && @\textbf{C}@<std::remove_cvref_t<std::ranges::range_reference_t<T>>>; // #1

template<typename T>
concept range_of_integrals = std::ranges::range<T> && @\textbf{std::integral}@<std::remove_cvref_t<std::ranges::range_reference_t<T>>>; // #2

\end{colorblock}

Note that this transformation does not change any other behavior of normalization, i.e., concept template-parameters that appear within other atomic constraints
are not substituted, and arguments that are not concept names are not substituted either.

\subsection{Fold expressions involving concept template-parameters}

Our proposed design allow for subsumption in the the presence of fold expressions whose pattern is a concept.
(For the non-concept case, see \paper{P2963R0})


\begin{colorblock}
template <
    typename T,
    template <typename...> concept... C>
concept all_of = (C<T> && ...);
\end{colorblock}

Once substituted, the sequence of binary \tcode{\&\&} or \tcode{||} is normalized,
\tcode{all_of}, \tcode{any_of}, and so on can then be implemented in a way that supports subsumption.

One very important case where this facility is absolutely essential is constraining tuples (and other algebraic data-types) by dimension:

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename X, template <typename> concept... C>
concept product_type_of = (... && C<std::tuple_element_t<C...[?], X>>);
//   index-of-current-element, not proposed, but needed  ~~~~~~~
\end{colorblock}

\paper{P2632R0} discusses alternatives to the awful index-of-current-element syntax above.

\subsection{ADL}

Similar to variables, variable templates and concepts are not associated entities when performing argument-dependent lookup.
This is consistent with previous work (for example \paper{N3595} and \paper{P0934R0}) and the general consensus toward ADL.

\subsection{Deduction and partial ordering}

Variable and concept template-parameters should be deducible from a template argument of a class template, used in the argument list of a function,
including a function that is synthesized for the purpose of partial ordering; i.e., the intent is that the following is well-formed:

\begin{colorblock}
template <template <class> auto V, template <class> concept C>
struct A {}; // A takes a variable template template argument

template <template <class T> auto V, template <class> concept C>
void foo(A<V, C>);  // can accept any specialization of A; V and C are deduced

template <class T>
auto Var = 0;

template <class T>
concept Concept = true;

void test() {
    foo(A<Var, Concept>{});
}
\end{colorblock}

[\href{https://compiler-explorer.com/z/66dr6fnKj}{Run this example on Compiler Explorer}]

\subsection{Equivalence of atomic constraints}

One interesting concept to consider is \tcode{tuple_of}, which would e.g., allow constraining a function on a \placeholder{tuple-like}
of integrals, a frequent use case in scientific computation.

In the absence of member and alias packs, a \tcode{tuple_like} concept could look like

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename T, int N>
constexpr bool __tuple_check_elements = [] {
    if constexpr (N == 0)
      return true;
    else if constexpr(requires (T t) {
        typename std::tuple_element_t<N-1, T>;
        { std::get<N-1>(t) };
    })
      return  __tuple_check_elements<T, N-1>;
    return false;
}();

template <typename T>
concept tuple_like = requires {
    typename std::tuple_size<T>::type;
} &&  __tuple_check_elements<T, std::tuple_size_v<T>>;
\end{colorblock}

Here, we use a constexpr variable template to check the constraint on individual elements.
We can trivially adapt this code to take a concept argument:

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename T, template <typename> concept C>
concept decays_to = C<std::decay_t<T>>;

template <typename T, int N, template <typename> concept C>
constexpr bool __tuple_check_elements = [] {
    if constexpr (N == 0)
      return true;
    else if constexpr(requires (T t) {
        typename std::tuple_element_t<N-1, T>;
        { std::get<N-1>(t) } -> decays_to<C>;
    })
      return  __tuple_check_elements<T, N-1, C>;
    return false;
}();

template <typename T, template <typename> concept C>
concept tuple_of = requires {
    typename std::tuple_size<T>::type;
} &&  __tuple_check_elements<T, std::tuple_size_v<T>, C>;
\end{colorblock}

And this works fine, but \tcode{__tuple_check_elements} is an atomic constraint, so we cannot
establish a subsumption relationship for this concept.

With a sufficient number of pack features, we could probably write a concept that checks all elements with a single constraint,
i.e.,

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename T, typename E, int N, template <typename> concept C>
concept __tuple_of_element = requires (T t) {
    typename std::tuple_element_t<N, T>;
    { std::get<N>(t) } -> decays_to<C>;
} &&  C<std::tuple_element_t<0, T>>;

template <typename T, template <typename> concept C>
concept tuple_of = requires {
    typename std::tuple_size<T>::type;
} &&  (__tuple_of_element<T, T::[:], current_expansion_index_magic(), C> && ...);
\end{colorblock}

But in addition to relying on imaginary features, this is pretty inefficient since ordering complexity would be proportional to the square of the number of tuple elements.

Fortunately, while checking satisfaction does require looking at every element, we can look at just one element to establish subsumption in this particular case.

We can rewrite our concept as

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename T, int N, template <typename> concept C>
concept __tuple_of_element = requires (T t) {
    typename std::tuple_element_t<N, T>;
    { std::get<N>(t) } -> decays_to<C>;
} &&  C<std::tuple_element_t<0, T>>;

template <typename T, int N, template <typename> concept C>
constexpr bool __check_tuple_elements = [] {
    if constexpr (N == 1)
        return true;
    else if constexpr(__tuple_of_element<T, N-1, C>)
        return  __check_tuple_elements<T, N-1, C>;
    return false;
}();

template <typename T, template <typename> concept C>
concept tuple_of = requires {
    typename std::tuple_size<T>::type;
} &&  (std::tuple_size_v<T>  == 0 || (
         // Check the first element with a concept to establish subsumption
        __tuple_of_element<T, 0, C> &&
        // Check constraint satisfaction for subsequent elements
        __check_tuple_elements<T, std::tuple_size_v<T>, C>
));
\end{colorblock}

[\href{https://compiler-explorer.com/z/n6nsdj37j}{Run this example on Compiler Explorer}]

For this to work, the concept template-parameter C needs to be substituted
in the concept \tcode{__tuple_of_element} but not in the atomic constraint
\tcode{__check_tuple_elements<T, std::tuple_size_v<T>, C>}.

Atomic constraints also need to ignore concept template-parameters for the purpose
of comparing their template arguments when establishing atomic constraint equivalence during subsumption.


\section{Status of this proposal and further work}

Our main priority should be to make progress on some form of universal template parameters.
We will have an implementation of universal template parameters for the Standards Committee meeting in Kona.
Before that, we need to ensure concepts and variable-template template-parameters are supported features so that universal
template-parameters support the gamut of entities that could reasonably be used as template-parameters.

As part of that, subsumption for concept template-parameters, as proposed in this paper, as well as subsumption of fold expressions
should be considered an integral part of the design since adding them later might be somewhat annoying. (It could affect existing code, in theory.)

\section{More examples}

\section{Things to be careful about}

Concepts have carefully designed limitations aimed to make subsumption possible and reasonably efficient.
Care has to be taken not to change that.

In particular, specialization of concepts is not allowed nor is declaring concepts in classes or other non-global (potentially dependent)
contexts.

Concept template-parameters need to be substituted when evaluating constraints, but other arguments do not.
Efficient memoization is still possible by caching concept template arguments (and only concept template arguments) along the concept.

Concept template-parameters do not allow a concept to refer to itself, i.e., recursion.
Universal template-parameters may allow recursion.

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename T, __any C, typename...Args>
concept Y = C<C, Args...>;

template <typename T, template <typename...> Concept , typename...Args>
concept Foo = Concept<T, Args...>;

Y<int, Foo>;
\end{colorblock}

This will need careful consideration, but we have options, such as preventing the same concept name from appearing multiple times
or having an implementation-defined limit for how many concepts can be replaced during subsumption.

\section{Implementation}

The paper as proposed has been implemented in a fork of Clang and is available on compiler-explorer.
The implementation revealed no particular challenge. In particular, we confirmed that the proposed changes
do not prevent memoization for subsumption and satisfiability, i.e., a concept and the set of its concept parameters
are what needs to be cached.

\rSec2[basic.lookup.argdep]{Argument-dependent name lookup}%

\pnum
For each argument type \tcode{T} in the function call,
there is a set of zero or more \defnx{associated entities}{entity!associated}
to be considered.
The set of entities is determined entirely by
the types of the function arguments
(and any \changed{template}{\grammarterm{type-template-parameter}
} template arguments).
Any \grammarterm{typedef-name}s and \grammarterm{using-declaration}{s}
used to specify the types
do not contribute to this set.
The set of entities
is determined in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If \tcode{T} is a fundamental type, its associated set of
    entities is empty.

    \item If \tcode{T} is a class type (including unions),
    its associated entities are:
    the class itself;
    the class of which it is a member, if any;
    and its direct and indirect base classes.
    Furthermore, if \tcode{T} is a class template specialization,
    its associated entities also include:
    the entities
    associated with the types of the template arguments
    provided for template type parameters;
    the templates used as template template arguments; and
    the classes of which any member templates used as template template
    arguments are members.
    \begin{note}
        Non-type template arguments do not
        contribute to the set of associated entities.
    \end{note}

    \item If \tcode{T} is an enumeration type,
    its associated entities are \tcode{T}
    and, if it is a class member, the member's class.

    \item If \tcode{T} is a pointer to \tcode{U} or an array of \tcode{U},
    its associated entities are those associated with \tcode{U}.

    \item If \tcode{T} is a function type, its associated
    entities are those associated with the function parameter types and those
    associated with the return type.

    \item If \tcode{T} is a pointer to a member function of a class
    \tcode{X}, its associated entities are those associated
    with the function parameter types and return type, together with those
    associated with \tcode{X}.

    \item If \tcode{T} is a pointer to a data member of class \tcode{X}, its
    associated entities are those associated with the member
    type together with those associated with \tcode{X}.
\end{itemize}
In addition, if the argument is an overload set or the address of such a set,
its associated entities
are the union of those associated with each of the
members of the set, i.e., the entities associated with its
parameter types and return type.
Additionally, if the aforementioned overload set is named with
a \grammarterm{template-id}, its associated entities also include
its template \grammarterm{template-argument}{s} \added{denoting a class template or an alias template} and
those associated with its type \grammarterm{template-argument}s.

Argument-dependent lookup finds
all declarations of functions and function templates that
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    are found by a search of any associated namespace, or
    \item
    are declared as a friend \iref{class.friend} of any class
    with a reachable definition in the set of associated entities, or
    \item
    are exported,
    are attached to a named module \tcode{M} \iref{module.interface},
    do not appear in the translation unit containing the point of the lookup, and
    have the same innermost enclosing non-inline namespace scope as
    a declaration of an associated entity attached to \tcode{M} \iref{basic.link}.
\end{itemize}
If the lookup is for a dependent name \iref{temp.dep,temp.dep.candidate},
the above lookup is also performed
from each point in the instantiation context \iref{module.context} of the lookup,
additionally ignoring any declaration that
appears in another translation unit,
is attached to the global module, and
is either discarded \iref{module.global.frag} or has internal linkage.

A \defn{concept-id} is a \grammarterm{simple-template-id}
where the \grammarterm{template-name} is a \grammarterm{concept-name} \added{or names a \grammarterm{concept-parameter}}.
A concept-id is a prvalue of type \tcode{bool}, and
does not name a template specialization.
A concept-id evaluates to \tcode{true}
if the concept's
normalized \grammarterm{constraint-expression} \iref{temp.constr.decl}
is satisfied \iref{temp.constr.constr} by the specified template arguments and
\tcode{false} otherwise.
\begin{note}
    Since a \grammarterm{constraint-expression} is an unevaluated operand,
    a concept-id appearing in a \grammarterm{constraint-expression}
    is not evaluated except as necessary
    to determine whether the normalized constraints are satisfied.

\pnum
A \defn{pack} is
a template parameter pack,
a function parameter pack,
or an \grammarterm{init-capture} pack.
The number of elements of a template parameter pack
or a function parameter pack
is the number of arguments provided for the parameter pack.
The number of elements of an \grammarterm{init-capture} pack

\pnum
\indextext{pattern|see{pack expansion, pattern}}%
A \defn{pack expansion}
consists of a \defnx{pattern}{pack expansion!pattern} and an ellipsis, the instantiation of which
produces zero or more instantiations of the pattern in a list (described below).
The form of the pattern
depends on the context in which the expansion occurs. Pack
expansions can occur in the following contexts:

\begin{itemize}
\item In a function parameter pack \iref{dcl.fct}; the pattern is the
\grammarterm{parameter-declaration} without the ellipsis.

\item In a \grammarterm{using-declaration} \iref{namespace.udecl};
the pattern is a \grammarterm{using-declarator}.

\item In a template parameter pack that is a pack expansion \iref{temp.param}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    if the template parameter pack is a \grammarterm{parameter-declaration};
    the pattern is the \grammarterm{parameter-declaration} without the ellipsis;

    \item
    if the template parameter pack is a \grammarterm{type-parameter};
    the pattern is the corresponding \grammarterm{type-parameter}
    without the ellipsis. % lah: set the period as replaced by a semicomma

    \begin{addedblock}
    \item
    if the template parameter pack is a \grammarterm{template-template-parameter};
    the pattern is the corresponding \grammarterm{template-template-parameter}
    without the ellipsis.
    \end{addedblock}
\end{itemize}

\item In an \grammarterm{initializer-list} \iref{dcl.init};
the pattern is an \grammarterm{initializer-clause}.

\item In a \grammarterm{base-specifier-list} \iref{class.derived};
the pattern is a \grammarterm{base-specifier}.

\item In a \grammarterm{mem-initializer-list} \iref{class.base.init} for a
\grammarterm{mem-initializer} whose \grammarterm{mem-initializer-id} denotes a
base class; the pattern is the \grammarterm{mem-initializer}.

\item In a \grammarterm{template-argument-list} \iref{temp.arg};
the pattern is a \grammarterm{template-argument}.

\item In an \grammarterm{attribute-list} \iref{dcl.attr.grammar}; the pattern is
an \grammarterm{attribute}.

\item In an \grammarterm{alignment-specifier} \iref{dcl.align}; the pattern is
the \grammarterm{alignment-specifier} without the ellipsis.

\item In a \grammarterm{capture-list} \iref{expr.prim.lambda.capture}; the pattern is
the \grammarterm{capture} without the ellipsis.

\item In a \tcode{sizeof...} expression \iref{expr.sizeof}; the pattern is an
\grammarterm{identifier}.

\item In a \grammarterm{fold-expression} \iref{expr.prim.fold};
the pattern is the \grammarterm{cast-expression}
that contains an unexpanded pack.
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}
    \begin{codeblock}
        template<class ... Types> void f(Types ... rest);
        template<class ... Types> void g(Types ... rest) {
            f(&rest ...);     // ``\tcode{\&rest ...}'' is a pack expansion; ``\tcode{\&rest}'' is its pattern

Two \grammarterm{template-id}{s} are the same if
\begin{itemize}
\item

\grammarterm{operator-function-id}{s}, or
\grammarterm{literal-operator-id}{s}
refer to the same template, and

\item
their corresponding type \grammarterm{template-argument}{s}

refer to the same template.

\rSec3[temp.func.order]{Partial ordering of function templates}

\pnum
\indextext{overloading!resolution!template}%
\indextext{ordering!function template partial|see{template, function, partial ordering}}%
If multiple function templates share a name,
the use of that name can be ambiguous because
template argument deduction \iref{temp.deduct} may identify
a specialization for more than one function template.
\defnx{Partial ordering}{template!function!partial ordering}
of overloaded function template declarations is used in the following contexts
to select the function template to which a function template specialization
refers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    during overload resolution for a call to a function template specialization \iref{over.match.best};
    \item
    when the address of a function template specialization is taken;
    \item
    when a placement operator delete that is a
    function template
    specialization
    is selected to match a placement operator new
    \iref{basic.stc.dynamic.deallocation,expr.new};
    \item
    when a friend function declaration \iref{temp.friend}, an
    explicit instantiation \iref{temp.explicit} or an explicit specialization \iref{temp.expl.spec} refers to
    a function template specialization.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
Partial ordering selects which of two function templates is more
specialized than the other by transforming each template in turn
(see next paragraph) and performing template argument deduction
using the function type.
The deduction process determines whether
one of the templates is more specialized than the other. If so, the
more specialized template is the one chosen by the partial ordering
process.
If both deductions succeed, the partial ordering selects
the more constrained template (if one exists) as determined below.

\pnum
To produce the transformed template, for each type, non-type, or template
template parameter (including template parameter packs \iref{temp.variadic}
thereof) synthesize a unique type, value, or class template
respectively and substitute it for each occurrence of that parameter
in the function type of the template.


\ednote{Do we need to change anything here?} % lah: it doesn't seem you want this to be in your final paper.

\begin{note}
    The type replacing the placeholder
    in the type of the value synthesized for a non-type template parameter
    is also a unique synthesized type.
\end{note}
Each function template $M$ that is a member function
is considered to have
a new first parameter of type $X(M)$, described below,
inserted in its function parameter list.
If exactly one of the function templates was considered by overload resolution
via a rewritten candidate \iref{over.match.oper}
with a reversed order of parameters,
then the order of the function parameters in its transformed template
is reversed.
For a function template $M$ with cv-qualifiers \cv{}
that is a member of a class $A$:
