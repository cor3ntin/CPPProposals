Initial revision

\section{Motivation}

The motivation for pack indexing is covered in "Generalized pack declaration and usage" (\paper{P1858R2}) and
"A plan for better template meta programming facilities in C++26" \cite{P2632R0}.

The short version is that packs are sequences of types/expressions, and indexing is a fundamental operation on sequences.
C++ and its users have so far relied on deduction or library facilities such as \tcode{index_sequence} or full-fledged template metaprogramming libraries such as
mp11 and boost.hana to extract the Nth element of a pack, which has a high cost both in terms of code complexity and compiler throughput.

This paper proposes a new code language syntax to index packs of types (yielding a type), and packs of expressions (yielding an expression).

Previous works in this area also include \paper{P0565R0}, \paper{P1803R0}, \paper{N3761} and \paper{N4235}.

\section{Syntax}

The general syntax is \tcode{\placeholder{name-of-a-pack} ... [constant-expression]}.
The syntax has the benefit of reusing familiar elements (\tcode{...} usually denotes a pack expansion) and \tcode{[]} subscripts,
It is therefore natural that indexing a pack expansion reuses these elements.

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename... T>
constexpr auto first_plus_last(T... values) ->  T...[0] {
    return T...[0](values...[0] + values...[sizeof...(values)-1]);
}
int main() {
    //first_plus_last(); // ill-formed
    static_assert(first_plus_last(1, 2, 10) == 11);
}
\end{colorblock}

This is a syntax that is used by Circle and that was initially proposed by \paper{P1858R2}.

\subsection{Other syntaxes considered}

The pack...[index] syntax was selected for this proposal after considering a
number of other possible syntaxes, some of which have been proposed by other
committee members:

\begin{itemize}
\item \tcode{pack.[index]} - \paper{N4235}
\item \tcode{pack<index>} or \tcode{pack...<index>}
\item \tcode{packexpr(args, I)} - \paper{P1803R0}
\item \tcode{[index]pack} - \paper{P0535R0}
\item Pack Objects - \paper{P2671R0}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{So, which syntax to pick?}

Any syntax would be better than
\href{https://twitter.com/incomputable/status/1590733659694583808}{the status quo}.
However, having done an analysis of different options, the original choice,
\tcode{Pack...[N]}, still seems to be the best option, as it is straightforward
and consistent with existing pack features.  What follows is a detailed
analysis of the different options, but the reader may want to skip forward to
the "Pack Index" section if the proposed syntax is acceptable to them.

Before arguing what the best syntax is, which is ultimately subjective, we need to understand the constraints:
\begin{itemize}
\item An indexed pack can produce a type, an expression, and maybe in the future a template template parameter, a universal template, etc, so we need a syntax
that can work in all contexts.
\item We want a syntax that can be expanded to support slicing in the future.
\item Pack elements can be array-like or tuple-like, so we need to be careful
  about ambiguities.In particular, directly applying a subscript to a pack
  (\tcode{P[i]}, where \tcode{P} is a pack) is not viable. Indeed, indexing a
  pack of arrays (\tcode{ArrayPack...[index]}), indexing each array in a pack
  (\tcode{ArrayPack[index]...}), indexing a single array with a pack of indexes
  (\tcode{Array[IndexPack]...}), and indexing each array in a pack of arrays
  with an index from an (equal-length) pack of indexes
  (\tcode{ArrayPack[IndexPack]...}) are different operations, all of which are
  useful. [\href{https://compiler-explorer.com/z/E86h8eMG1}{This example}]
  shows how, using the proposed syntax, one can distinguish between indexing
  the arrays from a pack with indexes from a pack
  (\tcode{ArrayPack[IndexPack]...}) and indexing a pack of arrays with a pack
  of indexes (\tcode{ArrayPack...[IndexPack]...}).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{pack.[index]}

Historically in C++ (and C++-like languages), a single dot denotes member access.
Reusing that syntax for pack indexing would introduce a semantics inconsistency.

More importantly, it may close the door to future evolutions.
\paper{P1858R0} proposes \tcode{tuple-like.[N]} as sugar over \tcode{get<N>(tuple-like)}
and \tcode{aggregate.[N]} returning the $Nth$ data member of an aggregate.

Ideally, \tcode{tuple[N]} would just work. A few proposals have tried to improve the ergonomy of tuple indexing
\paper{P2726R0}, \paper{P0311R0}.

I don't think there is a technical limitation to making `tuple-like[N]` work, on types that do not otherwise define a \tcode{operator[]}.
\paper{P1858R2} prefers \tcode{.[]} to \tcode{[]} because it proposes not only to index tuple-like but also any other decomposable types such as aggregates.
An aggregate might have an \tcode{operator[]} already, and so there is a need to disambiguate.
Note that array-like classes are tuple-like, but their \tcode{operator[]} has the same semantics as what tuple indexing would do.

Whether tuple-indexing should be spelled \tcode{.[]} or \tcode{[]} depends on whether indexing an aggregate is a frequent enough use case
to warrant a specific syntax, rather than indexing the pack formed by unpacking an aggregate (\tcode{aggregate[:]} - in the syntax of \paper{P1858R2}, \tcode{aggregate.[N]} is a shorthand for \tcode{aggregate[:]...[N]}).

If we don't find a shorthand syntax to index the fields of an aggregate useful, then we can index tuple-like objects with \tcode{tuple[N]} which would make
\tcode{pack.[N]} up for grab...

... Which does not mean we should. There is very little motivation to use syntax usually denoting member access for packs, except that it's an available syntax.

\subsubsection{Angle brackets}

We could use angle brackets instead of square brackets. I guess the argument is that \tcode{<>} is more template-ish and pack indexing is also template-ish.
However, there are existing practices in most languages for \tcode{[]} to be used for both indexing and slicing.
Being consistent with existing practice never hurt.
Besides, pack indexing will often occur in angle-bracket-heavy code, so using brackets for indexing too would not look better.

\subsubsection{Magic function}

\paper{P1803R0} proposed \tcode{packexpr(pack, N)}. ie \tcode{reserved-identifier(pack, N)}.
We'd need to find an identifier that is meaningful for all types of packs (not just expressions) and is not widely used.
It would most certainly have to be a globally reserved keyword (not a contextual one), as pack indexing can appear anywhere either a type, or an expression can appear. which is to say, everywhere.

Maybe \tcode{packelement(pack, index)}. This would work, but we would arguably need another identifier for slicing.

\subsubsection{\tcode{[N]pack...}}

Putting the index before the pack was explored by \paper{P0535R0}.
This would probably work, although some look-ahead to distinguish from lambdas may be necessary.
It doesn't appear to be any logic to that choice, besides the fact that it's available.

\subsubsection{Pack objects}

\paper{P2671R0} proposes a syntax (rather arbitrarily on the fact it's currently not used), to create a "pack object", or rather, to instruct the compiler to manipulate
a pack without expanding it.
The one motivating use case is the for expansion statement, where that syntax allows us to distinguish "looping" over a tuple versus looping over a pack in a non-ambiguous manner.
Other examples, including pack indexing and slicing, look similar but arguably worse using this "pack object" mechanism.

As noted, an expansion statement can be used with a pack using

\begin{colorblock}
    template for (auto elem : std::tuple(ts...)) { ... }
\end{colorblock}


Barry observes this is "wasteful" which is true, but a big part of the problem is that a tuple is a much heavier type than it ought to be,
and pack indexing is one of the tools we need to make tuples lighter - along with forwarding references deduction and member packs).

\subsubsection{Something else?}

We could entertain all sorts of syntaxes that are not yet used. 2 dots, 4 dots, \tcode{!}, \tcode{@} \$, etc.
None of them would be a logical extension of the existing grammar and, as we are extending an existing facility, we should aim for something more justified than simply "it's not yet used by something else"

\subsubsection{Too many dots?}

One of the arguments heard against the \tcode{T...[N]} syntax is the "too many dots" argument.
And it's true that code that does a lot of pack manipulation has some dots.
However, it does make sense and it's readable in actual code \href{https://github.com/seanbaxter/circle/blob/master/tuple/tuple.hxx}{like this implementation of tuple}.
\tcode{...} for pack expansions have a few advantages
\begin{itemize}
\item It is useful to be able to see at a glance which pattern is expanded, and where.
\item The syntax of pack declarations and pack expansion has so far been rather consistent and follows a given pattern. Multiple people have come up with the same syntax independently because it's sort of it the obvious extension of existing syntax.
\item Using \tcode{...\placeholder{postfix-syntax}} for this feature, and future pack-related features (and nothing else), gives us a clear reserved design space for packs.
\end{itemize}

\section{Allowable values for the pack index}

The index of a pack indexing expression or specifier is an integral constant expression between 0 and \tcode{sizeof...(pack) - 1}.
Empty packs can't be indexed.

In other proposals, a negative index, \tcode{-N}, would be interpreted as
indexing from the end of the pack (as an alias of \tcode{T...[sizeof...(T)-N]}).
However, a negative index could occur by accident, yielding surprising results.

Consider:

\begin{colorblock}
// Return the index of the first type convertible to Needle in Pack
// @\textbf{or -1 if Pack does not contain a suitable type}@.
template <typename Needle, typename... Pack>
auto find_convertible_in_pack;

// if find_convertible_in_pack<Foo, Types> is -1, T will be the last type, erroneously.
using T = Types...[find_convertible_in_pack<Foo, Types>];
\end{colorblock}

In general, incorrect computations in an index can lead to a negative value that should make the program ill-formed but would instead
yield an incorrect type.

Note however that circle does support from-the-end indexing using a negative index, and Sean Baxter reports no surprise from using this feature.

An alternative for indexing from the end is to provide a specific syntax; for example, C\# uses \tcode{\^{}} to mean "from the end", and Dlang interprets \tcode{\${}}
as the size of the array
\begin{colorblock}
using Foo = T...[0];
using Bar = T...[^1]; // First from the end
using Bar = T...[$ - 1]; // First from the end
\end{colorblock}

Given that there are different alternatives, all of which can be added later, and for which we do not have usage experience, this paper does not propose
from-the-end indexing.

\section{Indexing a pack of types}

Indexing a pack of type is a type specifier that can, like \tcode{decltype} appear:
\begin{itemize}
    \item As a simple-type-specifier
    \item As a base class specifier
    \item As a nested name specifier
    \item As the type of an explicit destructor call
\end{itemize}

\section{Type deduction}

Pack indexing specifiers should not allow deducing the pack from such an expression.

Consider:

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename... T>
void f(T...[0]);
f(0);
\end{colorblock}

It doesn't really make sense to start thinking about how deduction would work here or what that code would possibly mean.
We simply always consider pack indexing to be a non-deduced context.

\section{Indexing a pack of expressions}

The intent is that a pack indexing expression behaves exactly as the underlying expression would.
In particular, \tcode{decltype(id-dexpression) and \tcode{decltype(pack-index-expression)}} behave the same.

\section{Future Evolution}

The syntax can be extended  in subsequent proposals to support:

\begin{itemize}
\item Indexing packs introduced by structured bindings or other non-dependent packs
\item Indexing packs of template template parameters
\item From-the-end-indexing
\item Pack Slicing (Returning a subset of a pack as an unexpanded pack)
\item Packs of universal template parameters could be indexed in the same way.
\end{itemize}


\section{Potential impact on existing code}

In C++23, \tcode{T... [N]} is a valid syntax for declaring a function parameter matching a pack of unnamed arrays of size N.

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename... T>
void f(T... [1]); //
int main() {
    f<int, double>(nullptr, nullptr); // void f<int, double>(int [1], double [1])
}
\end{colorblock}

Neither MSVC nor gcc supports this syntax and this pattern does not appear outside of compiler test suites (from a search on \href{https://cs.github.com/}{Github}, \href{https://codesearch.isocpp.org/cgi-bin/cgi_ppsearch?q=...%5B&search=Search}{isocpp} and in VCPKG).

Should anyone be affected, a workaround is to name the variable.

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename... T>
void f(T... foo[1]);
\end{colorblock}

[\href{https://godbolt.org/z/T7v3ETz1G}{Demonstration}].


\section{Implementation}

This proposal is inspired by features implemented in the Circle compiler (with the same syntax).
The provided wording is based on an implementation in a fork of clang, which is available on \href{https://compiler-explorer.com/z/WKobTEq6x}{Compiler Explorer}.

As of the writing of the paper, the Clang implementation is known not to support pack indexing inside of the expansion of other template parameters.
I.e., the following is intended to work but currently does not

\begin{colorblock}
template <typename... Ts, int... N>
auto f(Ts... ts) {
    return std::tuple{ (ts...[N])... };
}
\end{colorblock}

We hope to fix these issues before the Kona meeting in November.

For an expression $E$, the type denoted by \tcode{decltype($E$)} is defined as follows:

\item if $E$ is an unparenthesized \grammarterm{id-expression}
naming a structured binding\iref{dcl.struct.bind},
\tcode{decltype($E$)} is the referenced type as given in
the specification of the structured binding declaration;

\item otherwise, if $E$ is an unparenthesized \grammarterm{id-expression}
naming a non-type \grammarterm{template-parameter}\iref{temp.param},
\tcode{decltype($E$)} is the type of the \grammarterm{template-parameter}
after performing any necessary
type deduction\iref{dcl.spec.auto,dcl.type.class.deduct};

\item otherwise, if $E$ is an unparenthesized \grammarterm{id-expression} or
an unparenthesized
class
member access\iref{expr.ref}, \tcode{decltype($E$)} is the
type of the entity named by $E$.

\indextext{pattern|see{pack expansion, pattern}}%
A \defn{pack expansion}
consists of a \defnx{pattern}{pack expansion!pattern} and an ellipsis, the instantiation of which
produces zero or more instantiations of the pattern in a list (described below).
The form of the pattern
depends on the context in which the expansion occurs. Pack
expansions can occur in the following contexts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item In a function parameter pack\iref{dcl.fct}; the pattern is the
    \grammarterm{parameter-declaration} without the ellipsis.

    \item In a \grammarterm{using-declaration}\iref{namespace.udecl};
    the pattern is a \grammarterm{using-declarator}.

    \item In a template parameter pack that is a pack expansion\iref{temp.param}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
        if the template parameter pack is a \grammarterm{parameter-declaration};
        the pattern is the \grammarterm{parameter-declaration} without the ellipsis;

        \item
        if the template parameter pack is a \grammarterm{type-parameter};
        the pattern is the corresponding \grammarterm{type-parameter}
        without the ellipsis.
    \end{itemize}

    \item In an \grammarterm{initializer-list}\iref{dcl.init};
    the pattern is an \grammarterm{initializer-clause}.

    \item In a \grammarterm{base-specifier-list}\iref{class.derived};
    the pattern is a \grammarterm{base-specifier}.

    \item In a \grammarterm{mem-initializer-list}\iref{class.base.init} for a
    \grammarterm{mem-initializer} whose \grammarterm{mem-initializer-id} denotes a
    base class; the pattern is the \grammarterm{mem-initializer}.

    \item In a \grammarterm{template-argument-list}\iref{temp.arg};
    the pattern is a \grammarterm{template-argument}.

    \item In an \grammarterm{attribute-list}\iref{dcl.attr.grammar}; the pattern is
    an \grammarterm{attribute}.

    \item In an \grammarterm{alignment-specifier}\iref{dcl.align}; the pattern is
    the \grammarterm{alignment-specifier} without the ellipsis.

    \item In a \grammarterm{capture-list}\iref{expr.prim.lambda.capture}; the pattern is
    the \grammarterm{capture} without the ellipsis.

    \item In a \tcode{sizeof...} expression\iref{expr.sizeof}; the pattern is an
    \grammarterm{identifier}.

    \begin{addedblock}
    \item In a \grammarterm{pack-index-expression} ; the pattern is an
    \grammarterm{id-expression}.
    \item In a \grammarterm{pack-index-specifier} ; the pattern is an
    \grammarterm{identifier}.
    \end{addedblock}

    \item In a \grammarterm{fold-expression}\iref{expr.prim.fold};
    the pattern is the \grammarterm{cast-expression}
    that contains an unexpanded pack.
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}
    \begin{codeblock}
        template<class ... Types> void f(Types ... rest);
        template<class ... Types> void g(Types ... rest) {
            f(&rest ...);     // ``\tcode{\&rest ...}'' is a pack expansion; ``\tcode{\&rest}'' is its pattern
        }
    \end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
For the purpose of determining whether a pack satisfies a rule
regarding entities other than packs, the pack is
considered to be the entity that would result from an instantiation of
the pattern in which it appears.

\pnum
A pack whose name appears within the pattern of a pack
expansion is expanded by that pack expansion. An appearance of the name of
a pack is only expanded by the innermost enclosing pack expansion.
The pattern of a pack expansion shall name one or more packs that
are not expanded by a nested pack expansion; such packs are called
\defnx{unexpanded packs}{pack!unexpanded} in the pattern. All of the packs expanded
by a pack expansion shall have the same number of arguments specified. An
appearance of a name of a pack that is not expanded is
ill-formed.
\begin{example}
    \begin{codeblock}
        template<typename...> struct Tuple {};
        template<typename T1, typename T2> struct Pair {};

        template<class ... Args1> struct zip {
            template<class ... Args2> struct with {
                typedef Tuple<Pair<Args1, Args2> ... > type;
            };
        };

        typedef zip<short, int>::with<unsigned short, unsigned>::type T1;
        // \tcode{T1} is \tcode{Tuple<Pair<short, unsigned short>, Pair<int, unsigned>>}
        typedef zip<short>::with<unsigned short, unsigned>::type T2;
        // error: different number of arguments specified for \tcode{Args1} and \tcode{Args2}

        template<class ... Args>
        void g(Args ... args) {                   // OK, \tcode{Args} is expanded by the function parameter pack \tcode{args}
            f(const_cast<const Args*>(&args)...);   // OK, ``\tcode{Args}'' and ``\tcode{args}'' are expanded
            f(5 ...);                               // error: pattern does not contain any packs
            f(args);                                // error: pack ``\tcode{args}'' is not expanded
            f(h(args ...) + args ...);              // OK, first ``\tcode{args}'' expanded within \tcode{h},
            // second ``\tcode{args}'' expanded within \tcode{f}
        }
    \end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
The instantiation of a pack expansion considers
items $\tcode{E}_1, \tcode{E}_2, \dotsc, \tcode{E}_N$,
where
$N$ is the number of elements in the pack expansion parameters.
Each $\tcode{E}_i$ is generated by instantiating the pattern and
replacing each pack expansion parameter with its $i^\text{th}$ element.
Such an element, in the context of the instantiation, is interpreted as
follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    if the pack is a template parameter pack, the element is
    an \grammarterm{id-expression}
    (for a non-type template parameter pack),
    a \grammarterm{typedef-name}
    (for a type template parameter pack declared without \tcode{template}), or
    a \grammarterm{template-name}
    (for a type template parameter pack declared with \tcode{template}),
    designating the $i^\text{th}$ corresponding type or value template argument;

    \item
    if the pack is a function parameter pack, the element is an
    \grammarterm{id-expression}
    designating the $i^\text{th}$ function parameter
    that resulted from instantiation of
    the function parameter pack declaration;
    otherwise

    \item
    if the pack is an \grammarterm{init-capture} pack,
    the element is an \grammarterm{id-expression}
    designating the variable introduced by
    the $i^\text{th}$ \grammarterm{init-capture}
    that resulted from instantiation of
    the \grammarterm{init-capture} pack.
\end{itemize}
When $N$ is zero, the instantiation of a pack expansion
does not alter the syntactic interpretation of the enclosing construct,
even in cases where omitting the pack expansion entirely would
otherwise be ill-formed or would result in an ambiguity in the grammar.

\pnum
The instantiation of a \tcode{sizeof...} expression\iref{expr.sizeof} produces
an integral constant with value $N$.

\begin{addedblock}
\pnum

When instantiating a \grammarterm{pack-index-expression} $P$,
let $K$ be the index of $P$.
The instantiation of $P$ is the \grammarterm{id-expression} \tcode{$\mathtt{E}_K$}.


When instantiating a \grammarterm{pack-index-specifier} $P$,
let $K$ be the index of $P$.
The instantiation of $P$ is the \grammarterm{typedef-name} \tcode{$\mathtt{E}_K$}.
